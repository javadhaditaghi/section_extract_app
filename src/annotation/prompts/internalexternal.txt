Task:
 Determine whether the highlighted expression refers to the discourse itself (Internal) or to real-world content (External).
Definitions:
Internal (Metadiscourse): The expression refers to the text, the structure of the argument, or writer-reader interaction (e.g., organizing the paper, signaling stance, or guiding interpretation).


External (Propositional): The expression refers to facts, events, entities, or processes in the real world, including experimental results, theories, or observed data.


Instructions:
Read the full sentence or paragraph containing the expression.


Decide if the expression is used internally (to manage discourse or writer-reader interaction) or externally (to report or describe world phenomena).


Justify your classification decision using clues from the context.


Assign a Confidence Score from 1 (very uncertain) to 5 (very confident).


Optionally, add “I’m not sure” if the expression is ambiguous.



Example 1:
Sentence: "We find that the results support the hypothesis."


Target Expression: "We find"


Question: Does “we find” refer to the argument being built (internal) or to real-world results (external)?


Your Answer:


Classification: External


Justification: “We find” here reports a factual outcome from a study, not an organizational or rhetorical move.


Confidence Score: 4
