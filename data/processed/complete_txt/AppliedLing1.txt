My ‘pop’, who finished his formal education at age 12, has consistently been an example of
plain hard work and perseverance who continually encouraged me to pursue higher
education. My ‘äiti’ unknowingly taught me the importance of culture through her own
unwavering cultural convictions and introduced me to travel at a young age. It is these
components: perseverance, education, culture and travel
that define who I am today.
In remembrance of my big and only brother, John, who suddenly left this world while I was
nearing the end of this research. He will forever be in my heart and will always remain
irreplaceable.
Lastly, to a distinct few who has shown love, support, guidance and belief in me,
be it from Italy, Finland, Germany or the United States.

Abstract
This thesis aims to expand understanding of how language varies according to context by investigating
the written-to-be-spoken language of political discourse (Wilson 1990; Chilton and Schaffner 2002;
Wodak and Chilton 2005; Fairclough 2003; van Dijk 2008; Cap et al 2013). Specifically, the study
demonstrates the existence of sub-genres in varying contexts of situation within the genre of political
discourse by investigating the generic structure of political speeches of similar registers, thus a
‘repertoire of registers’ (Bakhtin 1986; Martin 1992). This study views genre as being sociocultural with
specific goals in mind. It is sociocultural because it usually involves other people with the same cultural
‘norms’ and it has specific goals in mind to accomplish which require different stages to go through in
order to reach the specific goal (Martin & Rose 2007: 8). Therefore, to reveal the genre, it examines the
generic structure (Christie and Martin 1997; Martin and Rose 2007; Coffin et al 2009) of similar
registers. To reveal the generic structure, the study proposes Theme/Rheme, part of the textual
metafunction of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) (Halliday 1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004;
Eggins 2004; Thompson 2004), as a means of identifying generic moves within text.
Since there seems to be a gap of linguistic research within the genre of the American Presidential radio
address, this thesis linguistically investigated the radio addresses of Barack Obama during his first term
as President, 2009-2012. It focused on four diverse ‘repertoires of registers’, with each repertoire
comprising of four radio address topics: (1) the economy, (2) healthcare, (3) man-inflicted tragedy and
(4) Christmas. Each address within each repertoire was analysed for Theme/Rheme to determine its
generic structure and then was compared and contrasted to the other addresses within that topic to
investigate the hypothesis that they are similar in generic structure, thus a potential sub-genre. Further,
to highlight the possible sub-genre of one repertoire of registers, the generic structures of each
repertoire of registers were then contrasted with the other repertoires to reveal how they unfold
differently when compared to the others. Overall, the study, first, contributed linguistic analysis to the
genre of the radio address. Secondly, it demonstrated that Theme/Rheme is an effective tool for
revealing generic structure. Thirdly, the findings showed that each repertoire of topics were similar in
the following ways: the generic structure, the common thread found in the motif, and the types of theme
that indicated a generic move. This concluded that they then may be seen as a sub-genre within an
already established genre of the radio address. The benefits from the analysis showed that language
does function and unfold within specific contexts in which it is constructed and produced, and therefore,
the research stresses the importance of context of situation when analysing text.

Abstract (Italiano)
La presente tesi è stata realizzata con lo scopo di comprendere il modo in cui la lingua varia secondo il
contesto, tramite l'analisi dei discorsi politici che nascono come lingua scritta che dovrà poi essere
esposta oralmente (Wilson 1990; Chilton and Schaffner 2002; Wodak and Chilton 2005; Fairclough
2003; van Dijk 2008; Cap et al 2013).
Nello specifico, lo studio, analizzando la struttura generica dei discorsi politici di registri simili, definibili
pertanto come un “repertorio di registri”, dimostra la presenza di sottogeneri in contesti situazionali
variabili all’interno del genere del discorso politico (Bakhtin 1986; Martin 1992). In questo studio il
genere è considerato socioculturale e con scopi specifici. È ritenuto socioculturale poiché generalmente
coinvolge altre persone con le stesse “norme” culturali e possiede scopi specifici da raggiungere che
devono attraversare diverse fasi a tale obiettivo (Martin & Rose 2007:8). Per questo motivo, per rivelare
il genere, lo studio esamina la struttura generica (Christie and Martin 1997; Martin and Rose 2007;
Coffin et al 2009) dei registri simili. Per mostrare lo studio generico, la presente analisi propone
Tema/Rema, parte della metafunzione testuale della linguistica sistemico-funzionale (SFL) (Halliday
1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004; Eggins 2004; Thompson 2004) come mezzi per identificare le
mosse generiche all’interno del testo.
Poiché sembra esserci una mancanza di ricerca linguistica all’interno del genere del radio address dei
Presidenti Americani, la presente tesi ha analizzato a livello linguistico i suddetti discorsi di Barack
Obama durante il suo primo mandato come Presidente, 2009-2012. Lo studio si concentra su quattro
diversi repertori, ognuno dei quali comprende quattro argomenti del radio address: (1) economia, (2)
sanità, (3) atrocità inflitte dall’uomo e (4) Natale.
Ciascun discorso all’interno di ogni repertorio è stato analizzato per quanto riguarda Tema/Rema per
determinarne la struttura generica. In seguito, è stato eseguito un confronto e sono state evidenziate le
differenze con gli altri discorsi all’interno di quell’argomento per analizzare l’ipotesi secondo la quale i
discorsi sono simili nella struttura generica e costituiscono pertanto un potenziale sottogenere.
Inoltre, per sottolineare il possibile sottogenere di un repertorio di registri, sono state evidenziate le
differenze delle strutture generiche di ogni repertorio di registri rispetto ad altri repertori per mostrare
il modo diverso in cui si rivelano quando comparati agli altri.
Infine, lo studio ha in primo luogo contribuito all’analisi linguistica del genere del radio address.
Secondo, ha dimostrato che Tema/Rema costituiscono uno strumento effettivo per rivelare la struttura
generica. Terzo, le scoperte hanno mostrato che ogni repertorio dei vari argomenti era simile nei modi
seguenti: la struttura generica, il filo comune trovato nel tema dominante e i tipi di tema che indicano
una mossa generica.
iii
Questo ci porta alla conclusione secondo la quale essi possono essere visti come un sottogenere
all’interno di un genere già stabilito del radio address. I risultati dell’analisi hanno mostrato che la lingua
funziona e si rivela all’interno di contesti specifici in cui essa è costruita e prodotta, e pertanto, la ricerca
evidenzia l’importanza del contesto situazionale quando ci si approccia ad analizzare un testo.

Introduction
“To a grammarian, text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in many different ways.
It can be explored from many different points of view. But we can distinguish two main angles of
vision: one, focus on the text as an object in its own right; two, focus on the text as an instrument
for finding out about something else. Focusing on text as an object, a grammarian will be asking
questions such as: Why is it valued as it is? Focusing on text as instrument, the grammarian will
be asking what the text reveals about the system of the language in which it is spoken or written.”
Halliday and Matthiessen (2004: 3)
1. Establishing the Study
Halliday and Matthiessen above state that “text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in
different ways” and this study adopts the same viewpoint: language is rich and it is full of meaning. This
thesis focuses on ‘text as an instrument’ and aims to reveal the generic structure of written-to-be-
spoken language within the discourse of politics. The study postulates that sub-genres exist within the
genre of political discourse and can be revealed by investigating the generic structure of political
speeches.
This study takes the standpoint that genre is “a staged, goal oriented, purposeful activity in which
speakers engage as members of our culture” (Martin 1984: 25). It is further elaborated as “a staged,
goal-oriented social process. Social, because we participate in genres with other people; goal-oriented,
because we use genres to get things done; staged, because it usually takes us a few steps to reach our
goals” (Martin & Rose 2007: 8). Sub-genre is interpreted as a genre belonging to an already established
genre. And this study sees this corpus, the American presidential radio addresses, as a genre within
political discourse and the data of this study as possible sub-genres of the radio address. In order to
illustrate genre, the research examines the generic structure of such speeches and proposes a functional
approach of analysing the thematic structure by way of Theme and Rheme, which is part of the textual
metafunction of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) (Halliday 1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004;
Eggins 2004; Thompson 2004).

In order to study the goal, social purpose and generic structure of written-to-be-spoken language of
political discourse, study investigates the genre of the American Presidential radio address by way of a
Thematic structure analysis. The radio address is its own genre within political discourse and it is
embedded in the context of American culture. Scacci (2011) states, “genres exist in relation to certain
situational constraints, the weekly address is unique in its routine response to the week’s events
packaged for both public and press consumption”. The radio address thus is realised, operates and has
expected functions within the context of an American president and Americans are familiar with the
radio address due to its long history and tradition.
There has been research on the presidential weekly radio address, but there is a gap of linguistic
investigation of this genre. Martin (1984) researched Reagan’s return to the radio address, he revealed
that Reagan felt other forms of communication, such a news conferences, were more restrictive and
thus Reagan felt he was able to speak freely and be publically more present. Horvit, Schiffer, and Wright
(2008) investigated the Sunday press coverage of the radio address from 1982 to 2005. Since the
address is delivered on Saturdays, they found that the Sunday press coverage diminished over this time
period including the number of paragraphs citing the president. Meernik and Ault (2013) researched
the radio address from the perspective of foreign policy. They argued presidents have the ability to
manipulate the agenda of foreign policy and make more tactical choices by placing more attention on
domestic issues within the radio address. Han (2006) looked into the radio address as an old medium
combined with new strategies, thus comparing the addresses of Reagan and Clinton. Jones and Rowland
(2009) analysed the thematic overviews of Reagan’s addresses and researched his rhetorical strategies
and ideology. Research more from a language perspective, Oddo (2011) investigated ‘us’ versus ‘them’
through critical intertextual analysis (Thibault 1991), and compared the addresses of F.D. Roosevelt
and G.W. Bush through their legitimization strategies, thus establishing that Bush was among many
who misled the public into war. Oddo delved into the language of the addresses but did not contain any
linguistic analysis especially not to mention from an SFL perspective. Moreover, Scacco (2011) analysed
Obama’s radio address, but from a ritualistic rhetoric standpoint, and compared Obama’s addresses to
that of Clinton’s to understand how they both projected their presidencies onto the public, again, not
from a perspective of linguistics. Thus, there has been research on the radio address, but none from a
strictly functional linguistic perspective. The present study aims to fill this gap within studies of this
particular genre.
The present study focusses on the Radio Addresses of President Barack Obama during his first term as
President, 2009-2012. It concentrates on 4 different contexts of situations (repertoires) of the radio in
order to investigate the possibility of sub-genres within this genre: the economy (4 addresses);
2
healthcare (4 addresses); man-inflicted tragedies (4 addresses); and Christmas (4 addresses).
Ultimately, the study demonstrates that the generic structures of these addresses do vary according to
context of situation and that it is possible to establish a sub-genre within the Radio Address. Below,

This introductory chapter will first explain the functions of language, politics and discourse. Secondly, it
will state reasons for studying the grammar of political discourse. Next, the main theoretical concepts of
the study will be mapped out, from genre, cline of instantiation to context of situation. Fourth, the
overall research objective will be addressed. This includes the research questions, the data, the
analytical tool, the prospective results and the importance of the study. Finally, the structure of the
overall thesis will be explained.
1.2 The Function of Language, Politics, and Discourse
The function and connection between language and any social activity is inherent, since “the nature of
language has to be functional since language grows out of languaging and languaging itself is a form of
social life” (Hasan 2001: 4). Social activities encompass many diverse events both written and spoken,
such as greetings, cards, service encounters, casual conversations, arguments, telephone enquiries,
instructions, lectures, debates, plays, jokes, or games (Martin and Rose 2007: 8). All types of social
activities are related to different contexts of situations, and language is needed to communicate
according to the various contexts. Thus, the construction of language is dependent on the context in
which it was produced. Halliday (2009:56) explains that language provides the means by which we act
as well as reflect on the environment. Further, Hasan (2001: 8) maintains that context (of situation) is
important in two ways, first in shaping language as a system and then highlighting language as a
process.
This study stresses the importance of language, grammar, and the construction thereof within the
context of political discourse. The term discourse may be described as “anything beyond a clause”
(Schiffrin et al 2001:1). De Beaugrande (Rankema 2004: 49-50) has identified seven criteria for
textuality: (1) cohesion, (2) coherence, (3) intentionality, (4) acceptability, (5) informativeness, (6)
3
situationailty, (7) intertextuality. Further, political discourse can be defined as discourse produced by
actors or authors that commonly include politicians or political institutions (van Dijk 1997: 12).
According to van Dijk (2008: 90), political discourse includes “members of more powerful social groups
and institutions, and especially their leaders, have more or less exclusive access to and control over, one
or more types of public discourse”.
This functional connection between the social activity of politics and discourse is seen in Figure 1.2
below (Miller 2005: 4). The outer circle shows the social activity of politics and is then realised (and
dependent) on the language of political discourse in the second circle. The second circle shows the
dependent link that discourse has on the context in which it is produced. Further, in order for political
discourse to be realized in the second circle, it has a dependency on language and its grammar, noted in
the third most inner circle. Thus, the discourse is dependent on the language and grammar and its
variable options offered for the discourse to be constructed and produced within a ‘political’ context.

The third and innermost circle of language and grammar is explained according to the systemic
functional perspective (Halliday 2009: 341) as “that level of linguistic form at which operates closed
systems”, and includes four underlying categories: unit, structure, class, and system. Eggins and Slade
(2005: 48) state:
one of the most powerful aspects of the systemic approach is that language is viewed as a
resource for making not just one meaning at a time but several strands of meaning simultaneously. The
simultaneous layers of meaning can be identified in linguistic units of all sizes: in the word, phrase,
clause, sentence, and text.
4
The thesis investigates the layers of meaning in the grammatical unit of the clause of each radio
address. The following section will highlight some reasons for studying the grammar of political
discourse.
1.2.1 Why Study the Grammar of Political discourse?
The study of grammar is important. Halliday (2009: 51) poses the question: “what are the enabling
factors of grammar that make grammar such an enticing field to explore?” And he (ibid: 51-52)
immediately responds and sums up the answer in six concise salient points:
(1) They are comprehensive: they can ‘mean’ anything we want.
(2) They are extravagant: they always pack extra power.
(3) They are telescopic: they carry their history with them.
(4) They are non-autonomous: they interact with their environment.
(5) They are variable: they change under differing conditions.
(6) They are indeterminate: they work with approximations and tendencies.
Incorporating Halliday’s summation with the study of political discourse, the following six points are
directly connected to political discourse. First, “they are comprehensive: they can ‘mean’ anything we
want”. Within political discourse control is a prominent feature and, van Dijk (2008: 90) notes that
public leaders are able to access and control one or more variations of public discourse. In its potential
for meaning ‘anything we want’, the grammar of language can be manipulated by politicians in such a
way to make it mean exactly how they want it to mean. Thus, they have control over the production of
the discourse they produce.
Secondly, Halliday says “they are extravagant: they always pack extra power”. Power is a strong feature
of political discourse. Chilton (2004: 3) views politics as a ‘struggle for power’ between those who are
in a position of authority and ‘those who seek to resist it’. To reiterate van Dijk’s (2008: 90) point,
“members of more powerful social groups and institutions” are the ones that have the power to
produce political discourse. They are able to embed power into discourse, for example, by the use of
evaluative language, pronouns, metaphors and modality. Thus, this second point is connects to the
notion of power and political discourse because grammar has an extravagant way of packing power
within the production of language.
Third, he states “they are telescopic: they carry their history with them”. Political discourse has a long
history, it traces back to Aristotle’s ethos, pathos and logos: ethos pertaining to persuasion, pathos
5
appealing to the audience’s emotions, and logos presenting ideas logically (Campbell 1998; Miller
1993). Throughout time, political discourse has continuously perfected itself in its production and
construction, including the opportunity for politicians to have learned from others’ examples of
effective or of not so effective ways of communicating. As an example, the data of this study, the radio
address was first delivered in 1933 and every president since then has delivered a radio address,
including Obama. Therefore, it has had eighty-two years (as of 2017) to be continuously perfected
throughout the last 14 presidents (including the current President).
Points four and five are here explained concurrently, (4) “they are non-autonomous: they interact with
their environment” and (5) “they are variable: they change under differing conditions”. As mentioned,
language is produced out of given contexts, Thompson (2004: 10) believes that we are able to tell a
great deal about the context in which language was produced, why it was produced, and the reasons it
was expressed in a particular way. However, the contexts of politics are always changing and language
changes according to various situations, for example it may be a campaign speech, an inaugural speech
to begin a new administration or a radio address wishing the American people a merry Christmas. Thus,
Halliday’s points four and five are applicable to political discourse, for political discourse does both
“interact with their environment” and “change under differing conditions”.
The last and final point offered by Halliday is grammar “(is) indeterminate: it work(s) with
approximations and tendencies”. As grammar is indeterminate, so is political discourse: text is
constructed differently depending on the context. As mentioned above, it may be a campaign speech, an
inaugural address or a radio address. Thus, approximations and tendencies are found in political
discourse. These approximations and tendencies can be seen through common patterning: metaphors
(Beard 2000; Chilton 2004; Lakoff 1991), metaphor of war (Lakoff 2000), pronouns (Brown and Gilman
1960), rule of 3 (Thomas et al 2004) and metonymy (Beard 2000; Chilton 2004) (discussed in chapter
two). The following section maps out the main theoretical concepts of the thesis.
1.3 The Overall Study: Mapping the Research
While the previous section explained the function of language and political discourse, this section maps
out the overall structure of this study and addresses the important notions that are discussed
throughout the thesis. Figure 1.2 demonstrated the dependency between the social activity of politics,
the discourse of politics and the language/grammar produced as a result of political discourse; this
section delves into these notions on a functional theoretical level. Figure 1.3 above visually
demonstrates the study by mapping out the discussions that will sequentially be developed throughout
the following chapters. The following four points on the graph are discussed by walking one through
6
the study and demonstrate how the they are theoretically linked: (1) Genre and Generic Structuring
(Context of Culture); (2) The Cline of Instantiation; (3) Instances of Text (Register/Context of Situation);
(4) Then the data, different contexts of situation, economy, healthcare, man-inflicted tragedies, Christmas,
which are analysed in this study.

Genre and Generic Structuring
First, the study begins with the notion of genre (box 1), genre was referred to as a ‘social activity’ in
figure 1.2; for the rest of this study the notion of social activity within language will be referred to as
genre. As mentioned, this study refers to genre as a staged, goal-oriented and a social process (Martin &
Rose 2007: 8). It can be identified as part of the context of culture that it is realized, for culture is
embedded within genre. Culture can be viewed as a social-semiotic system which includes features that
constitute the systems and processes of an established culture (Halliday 2009: 243). Further, discourse
(text) in relation to context is an interaction that sets out to achieve a particular goal within culture,
thus initiating a text of a particular genre. And text will then most probably unfold in a certain way
(Eggins and Martin 1997: 236).
Within box number 1 in Figure 1.3 is genre and the embedded box of ‘generic structuring’. Generic
structuring inherently connects to genre, for it demonstrates the necessary stages needed in order to
reach the goal of any given genre. Coffin et al (2010:252) define generic structuring as the following:
[…] its unfolding organization (that) can be more usefully viewed from a functional perspective.
(This) provides insight into how different genres enable language users to achieve their social purposes
by moving through distinct functional stages.
The written-to-be spoken discourse that occurs within this specific genre has an expected structure, in
other words, it has its own generic structure, it follows in order to reach the goal of any particular radio
address. An example of a general generic structure may be as follows: introduction + the most current
event of the week or the most urgent matter needing to be addressed to the nation + conclusion. These
notions of genre and generic structuring are further explained in chapter three.
Cline of Instantiation
Directly beneath box number one of ‘genre and generic structuring’, is box number two, the ‘Established
System of Language Potential’. This box connects to the other two boxes, (from readers right to left)
‘Sub Potential Instance type’ and ‘One instance of written/spoken text’ (box 3). These three boxes are
sequentially connected and are known as the cline of instantiation. Halliday (2009: 162) generally
interprets a cline as graduations and continuities and does not view them as discrete classes but as a
continuous scale. Further, Halliday and Matthiessen (2004: 27) explain the cline of instantiation as
follows:
Patterns (that) can be viewed either from the system pole as sub-systems (right), or from the
instance pole, as instance types (left). If we start at the instance pole, we can study a single text and then
look for other texts that are like it according to certain criteria. When we study this sample of texts, we
can identify patterns that they all share, and describe these in terms of text type. By identifying a text
type, we are moving along the cline of instantiation away from the text pole towards the system pole.
This study applies Halliday’s notion of cline of instantiation for the purpose of investigating the
possibility of sub-genres within the radio address. Indicated in the box on the right, is the established
system of language potential, which this study connects and argues is inherently connected to the
notion of genre and generic structure. And, as is being here discussed, one example of an established
8
genre is the radio address. The study begins from the notion of genre, from varying situations within
this already established genre, because particular contexts of situation, with both general and specific
purposes within language, functions within ‘typical conglomerations of linguistic resources’ (Miller
2017: 16). The study discusses how a cluster of singular texts, as seen on the left, ‘One instance of
written/spoken text’, may have the potential to move towards the right of the cline to ‘sub potential type’
and finally to the ‘established system of language potential’ which could then lead to a potential sub-
genre within an established genre.
Instances of Text and the Analysis
In box number three, one instance of written or spoken text, is ‘text’ (language) seen from a close point of
view, showing instances taken from the potential of a particular text (Halliday 2009: 236). This step of
the study brings an instance of text to the level of context of situation. Context of situation can be
recognised by working bottom-up through text, such as that of a single radio address. A single radio
address can then be grouped together according to similar contexts of situations. Box number four
demonstrates the varying contexts of situation analysed in this study (economy, healthcare, man-
inflicted tragedies, Christmas) to determine the potential of sub-genres within these varying contexts.
Genre is inherently connected to context as mentioned, Eggins and Martin (1997: 236) state it is “an
interactant setting out to achieve a particular cultural goal (that) is most likely to initiate a text of a
particular genre, and that text is most likely to unfold in a particular way”. Here to reiterate, they state
that a particular genre will most likely unfold in a certain way. They (ibid) continue to say, “but the
potential for alternatives is inherent in the dialogic relationship between language and context.” Thus,
there is a possibility for alternatives within an established genre, and this study aims to investigate the
possibilities of alternatives within a genre.
Linked to the level of context of situation is the notion of register (Halliday 1979; Halliday and
Matthiessen 2004; Eggins and Martin 1997; Thompson 2004; Lukin 2008; Miller 2017) and its three
variables: field, tenor, and mode (discussed in chapter three). For the moment, one can state that
Halliday (1979: 201) defines register as “relevant features of a situation in which language has some
place are the field of social process, the tenor of social relationships and the mode of discourse itself”:
that is (i) what is going on, (ii) who are involved, and (iii) what part the text is playing – whether
written or spoken, in what rhetorical mode and so on; field answers: what is the text about, tenor
answers: who is taking part in the discourse, and mode answers: how is the language being used, what
realization resources are being used (written, spoken, visual resources, multimodal).
9
The field, tenor, and mode of the data are the following: field is President Obama speaking to the nation
regarding the most current events of the week; tenor is the US president speaking to the American
people (including Congress or his administration); and mode is written-to-be-spoken discourse,
presented in multimodal ways (the radio, video, internet, written transcripts). At this level of genre, it
does not reveal much about specific contexts of situation. Thus, by emphasizing register, the study will
investigate varying contexts of situation, to understand if sub-genres will emerge. For example, what is
the register when President Obama specifically speaks about the economy? Or what is the register
when he wishes the nation a happy holiday for Christmas?
1.3.1 Overall Research objective and Research Questions
To recapitulate, this study postulates that sub-genres exist within diverse contexts of situation within
the same genre of American radio address. The overall objective is concerned with the functional
perspective of genre in regards to the data. The aim is to reveal possible sub genres of political
discourse in varying contexts within this discourse by investigating the generic structure of the radio
address. Theme and Rheme, the strand of textual meaning of SFL, is proposed as an effective tool to
reveal the generic structures of the data.
The research questions of the study are as follows:
1. Are there potential sub-genres within the genre of the American presidential radio address?
2. Does the context of situation play a vital role in determining the possibility of sub-genres? If so,
to what extent does the stability of a contextual situation influence the stability of a possible
sub-genre and/or vice versa?
3. How then to reveal sub-genres within a genre? Would an analysis of the generic structure of the
addresses be a viable option?
4. Further, to investigate the generic structure, would Theme/Rheme analysis be an effective
method in determining the generic structure?
1.3.2 Data and Methods Summary
Data
In order to investigate the above theoretical questions, this study analysed the American Presidential
Radio Address. It is a weekly radio address of the President of America to keep the American people
informed of the current events of the week. It began with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and since
10
him, every U.S. president has used this form of communication, including Barack Obama. The study
analysed the radio addresses of President Obama during his first term as President, 2009-2012. Obama
delivered a total of 205 addresses (see appendix for list of all 205) during his first term. In this research,
there are four different groupings of the radio address delivered by Obama: the economy (4 addresses);
health care (4 addresses); man-inflicted tragedies (4 addresses); and Christmas (4 addresses). The data
has been systematically chosen, for example the economy comprises his first 4 addresses delivered on
the economy; health care includes his first 4 addresses delivered on this topic; man-inflicted tragedies
covers his only 4 addresses delivered on these type of tragedies during his first term; and Christmas
comprises his only 4 addresses delivered on Christmas during his first term. Thus, the study focuses on
4 varying contexts of situation to investigate the possibility of sub-genres within this genre. This will be
further discussed in detail in chapter four.
Methods
SFL concerns itself with revealing ‘how the organization of language’ is related to function. It models
“language and social context as a semiotic system in relationship to realization with one another”
(Martin 1997: 4). It is elaborated by a social context model and “language metaredound” (Lemke 1995),
meaning “social context comprises patterns of language patterns” (Martin 1997: 4). SFL investigates
patterning of language. As Eggins and Slade (2006: 48) state, “the systemic model is rich in analytical
techniques, allowing the analyst to focus on those patterns which are most relevant to specific data and
research interests.”
The above paragraphs explained the functional perspective of genre and generic structuring. Cline of
instantiation was introduced to visually demonstrate how an instance of text can move up the cline and
become a recognizable system of language, genre. Register, context of situation (Field, Tenor, Mode),
was introduced as a way to reveal texts in specific contexts.
The three variables of register (field, tenor, mode) are linguistically realized through the metafunctions
of SFL: ideational, interpersonal, and textual. Each of which are explained in brief simplistic terms:
Ideational is how one views the world and is linguistically realised through verbal processes
(transitivity), the Interpersonal relates to social interaction and is linguistically realised via the mood
system (subject and finite), modality, and the appraisal system (the language of evaluation). And last,
the Ideational and Interpersonal metafunctions are held together by the Textual metafunction, for one
“negotiate(s) ways of talking about that world: what kind of texts we can construct to represent
ideational and interpersonal meaning” (Eggins and Slade 2006: 50-51). The textual metafunction is
11
realised through cohesive devises such as conjunctions, and reference as well as the thematic structure
(Theme and Rheme).
Part of the textual metafunction of SFL is Theme/Rheme. It is used as the analytical tool to reveal the
generic structure of the data. It is used to answer if similar types of addresses can be identified as a sub-
genre. Theme is the ‘starting-point’ of the message; thus it determines what the clause is going to be
about (Halliday 1994: 38). Lipson (2006:147) explains that “it is part of the clause that is given special
textual status; Theme is what I, the speaker, have chosen for the message.” Theme gives the clause its
character as a message, it reveals the flow of the message and what the speaker or the writer decides to
place in the beginning of a clause in order to gain particular emphasis (Halliday 1994: 38). This study
argues that Theme/Rheme is the most effective tool to use to determine the generic structure of the
data; to determine if patternings are similar with other patternings which may then result in a possible
sub-genre. These methods are further explained in chapter three.
1.3.3 Research Parameters
The study focuses on the notion of genre and generic structuring of political discourse from a systemic
functional linguistic perspective by using Theme/Rheme of the textual metafunction. This work does
not include such fields of study as American Presidential Rhetoric (Campbell & Jamieson 1990; Hart
1984; Snyder & Higgins 1990; Stuckey 1989; Windt 1983), which is a vast field of its own. However, the
study recognises previous research on political discourse, for example, the use of pronouns (Wilson
1990; Chilton & Schaffner 1997; Fairclough 2003; Chilton 2004), common patternings found in political
speeches (Hart 1986), such as metaphors, metaphor of war (Lakoff 2000), and rule of 3 (Jones and
Peccei 2004). The study further recognises the importance of understanding the notion of power within
political discourse from the fields of critical discourse analysis (CDA) and political discourse analysis
(PDA). Power plays a large part in the content of these addresses, but it does not play a vital role within
the analysis of the generic structure of each individual address. Political discourse will be discussed in
chapter two. Specifically, this research focuses on four diverse ‘repertoires of registers’, with each
repertoire comprising of four radio address topics: (1) the economy, (2) healthcare, (3) man-inflicted
tragedy and (4) Christmas. Each address within each repertoire was analysed for Theme/Rheme to
determine its generic structure and then was compared and contrasted to the other addresses within
that topic to investigate the hypothesis that they are similar in generic structure, thus a potential sub-
genre. Further, to highlight the possible sub-genre of one repertoire of registers, the generic structures
of each repertoire of registers were then contrasted with the other repertoires to reveal how they
unfold differently when compared to the others.
12
1.3.4 Importance of Study and Prospective Results
The importance of this study is threefold. First, it reveals the generic structure of political speeches by
demonstrating the effectiveness of Theme/Rheme within SFL as an analytical tool. Secondly, it
highlights the notion of context of situation within political discourse, it establishes the importance of
register and its three variables (field, tenor, mode) according to different ‘contexts of political situations’
within discourse. And thirdly, the study shows how the structure of political speeches changes
according to the context in which speeches are given, thus establishing the notion of sub-genres.
The analysis reveals, from the four different categories that the more stable the situation was, the more
stable the generic structure was for that group of addresses. For example, the Christmas addresses
resulted in a very stable and expected generic structure, as the register of the context of situation for
Christmas does not change. Another somewhat stable situation was the register on the economy, where
President Obama persistently fought for the passing of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
(ARRA). These addresses had a somewhat stable generic structure since the register of them were
similar.
1.4 Structure of the Thesis
This thesis is divided into the following nine chapters. Chapter two will review previous research on
political discourse, such as the ideology of power (CDA, PDA), common patternings found in political
speeches and the most recent research on the notion of genre and political discourse. Chapter three will
discuss genre and the notion of context of culture. It will explain generic structuring and its inherent
relation to genre within relation to SFL. Then, the three metafunctions of SFL, Ideational, Interpersonal,
Textual, will be discussed. The Textual metafunction will be strongly emphasized because the system of
Theme/Rheme was determined the most beneficial to analyse the generic structures of the data.
Chapter four will introduce the data and methods. It will discuss the history of the radio address,
including an interesting parallel between Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), the first president to begin
the radio address, and President Barack Obama. It will discuss the specific data (addresses on the
economy, healthcare, man-inflicted tragedies, Christmas) and why this particular set of data was
selected. Further, the methods used for the analysis will be explained. Chapters five to eight will be the
analytical chapters: chapter five will investigate the genre and generic structuring of the 4 addresses on
the economy, chapter six examines the genre and generic structuring of 4 addresses where Obama
discusses problems of the healthcare system in the United States. Chapter seven explores how he
responded to man-inflicted tragedies by examining the genre and generic structuring of those 4
addresses. Finally, chapter eight investigates the genre and generic structuring of the 4 Christmas
13
addresses delivered during his first term. The thesis will then conclude with chapter nine, where it will
discuss the main findings, as well as its relevance. The study will also be evaluated with its implications
and possibilities for further research.

Chapter 2
The Language of Political Discourse
2.1 Introduction
The previous chapter introduced the overall aim and goals of this study. And, since this study’s primary
focus is the genre and generic structuring of political discourse, this chapter will introduce some
research within this field. Political discourse is a vast field that covers a wide range of discourse and
analytical methods (Wilson 2008: 398), it pertains to any political activity, where power and persuasion
are at play and decisions are made, where one has a particular goal and is in pursuit of reaching that
goal. The rhetoric of political discourse has been studied as far back as to the Greek and Roman empires
and its persuasive influence has been a topic of research with many scholars (Chaffee, 1975; Nimmo
and Sanders, 1981; Partington, 2010; Seidel, 1985).
It is through language that politicians, including presidents, communicate and influence their ideas onto
listeners. As Beard (2000: 18) expresses that language is a way to present and shape political argument
and contains one’s ideas. Thus within language, political discourse itself reflects the ‘ideological position’
of the speaker. Chilton (2004: 6) believes that ‘political activity’ exists only with the use of language. He
(ibid.: 14) states that “political actors recognise the role of language because its use has effects.” One
such example most commonly connected to this ideology is Aristotle’s ethos, pathos and logos. Ethos
pertains to persuasion, pathos engages the audience through emotional appeal and logos presents ideas
in a logical manner. Miller (1993: 161) explains “it is a basic component of what (Aristotle) called the
‘ethical’ argument (through which the speaker attempts to establish his or her good sense, good will
and good moral character) and oftentimes works hand-in-hand with the emotional ‘pathetic’ argument.
[…] (which is) taken together with the glossing of (a) logical connection […]”. This rhetoric then
influences political discourse, for a good political speaker should contain all three elements (ethos,
pathos and logos) in order to connect with members of the audience/community and in order to
persuade them through the use of language. So, discourse inherently has power and influence.
15
Furthermore, as mentioned, political discourse is a vast field that covers a wide range of discourse, so
language and persuasion are used for many different purposes. Reisigl (2008: 247), in his article
Rhetoric of political speeches, proposes at least eight different political fields of language that could be
studied, as seen in Figure 2.1:
# Political Fields that could be studied
1 The law making procedure
2 The formation of public attitudes, opinions and will
3 The party-internal formation of attitudes, opinions and will
4 The inter-party formation of attitudes, opinions and will
5 The organisation of international and interstate relations
6 Political advertising
7 The Political executive and administration
8 The various forms of political control
Figure 2.1: Political Fields that could be studied taken from Reisigl (2008: 247)
First, he proposes the law making procedure, then the formation of public attitudes, opinions and will,
thirdly, the party-internal formation of attitudes, opinions and will, fourthly, the inter-party formation of
attitudes, opinions and will, followed by the organisation of international and interstate relations, sixthly,
political advertising, seventh, the political executive and administration, and finally, various forms of
political control. This study’s focus of political discourse is strictly from a presidential context, the
political discourse of the American radio address, the political field researched, according to Reisigl’s
breakdown above, would be placed on number seven, the political executive and administration.
The chapter’s aim is to review some literature within this field and bring some understanding as to how
language and politics are inherently connected. This field of study could include, for example: American
Presidential Rhetoric (Campbell & Jamieson 1990; Hart 1984; Snyder & Higgins 1990; Stuckey 1989;
Windt 1983); US Presidential debates (Myers 2008; Airne & Benoit 2005); election posters (Richardson
& Wodak 2009); and policy papers (Muntigl et al. 2000; Krzyzanowski & Wodak 2010). But, this
chapter primarily focuses on three aspects. First, it will introduce the notion of power and political
discourse, particularly in relation to the fields of critical discourse analysis (CDA) and political
discourse analysis (PDA). Within SFL, PDA is known as Positive Discourse Analysis (Martin 2004). This
chapter will only focus on PDA from CDA perspective and not Positive Discourse Analysis by Martin (to
understand better Martin’s concepts please see his article on Positive Discourse Analysis (2004) or
16
Miller and Turci’s article on Construing the ‘Social Gospel’ of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a corpus assisted
study of free (2006)). Secondly, it highlights prominent features commonly associated within this
discourse. And thirdly, it presents some of the most recent research within the field of genre and
political discourse. The following section will discuss the ideology of power and political discourse.
2.2. Ideology of Power and Political Discourse
The ideology of power within discourse from a political perspective has been widely researched by
both political discourse analysts (PDA) and critical discourse analysts (CDA) (Chilton 1985; Geis 1987;
Wodak 1989; Wilson 1990, Wodak & Menz 1990; Chilton and Schaffner 2002; Fairclough 2003; Wodak
and Chilton 2005; van Dijk 2008) as a way to recognise how power is established and maintained
through discourse. Within political discourse, Chilton (2004: 3) identifies two broad views. First, he
views it as a struggle for power from two perspectives, either from those who aim to maintain and
assert their power, or from those who want to resist power, and this can be observed with governments
of various states. Secondly, he (ibid) views politics as “cooperation, as the practices and institutions that
a society has for resolving clashes of interest over money, influence and liberty.” Thus, political
discourse can be recognised either by the assertion of power or the resistance of power, or, on the other
hand, as a way to work together to resolve issues.
Moreover, there are groups or those at a higher social level that do have more control over public
discourse, including public leaders. van Dijk (2008: 90) recognises that “members of more powerful
social groups and institutions, and especially their leaders, have more or less exclusive access to and
control over, one or more types of public discourse”. Thus, it is more or less inherent that presidents
have control over their discourse as well as assert their power within the discourse. At times, this
power can be explicitly observed, and at other times it is implicitly embedded within language. CDA,
according to Wodak (1989: xiv), “wants to uncover and de-mystify certain social processes in this and
other societies, to make mechanisms of manipulation, discrimination, demagogy and propaganda
explicit and transparent”. So, CDA is concerned with the notion that power of political language could be
both explicit and/or implicit. Explicit power can be recognised quite easily with commands, with the
use of imperatives, for example, by directly telling one or a group what they need to do. However, this is
more likely to be associated with dictatorships rather than democracies within the western world.
Within the western world, power is much more implicitly placed within language and CDA researches
this type of power that is not easily recognisable. Some examples, may be the use of metaphors or the
‘rule of three’ which will be further discussed in the following section.
Fairclough supports this notion, he (2003: 9) states that CDA is concerned with ideologies that “are
representations of aspects of the world which can be shown to contribute to establishing, maintaining
17
and changing social relations of power domination and exploitation”. Therefore, it is through language
that politicians subtly demonstrate the social power relations within a community while maintaining
their political power and aim. CDA is beneficial in analysing political discourse in order to attempt to
uncover these power relations through the use of language. van Dijk (1997: 11) states “political
discourse analysis is both about political discourse, and it is also a critical enterprise. In the spirit of
contemporary approaches in CDA this would mean that critical-political discourse analysis deals
especially with the reproduction of political power, power abuse or domination through political
discourse.” And he (1997: 33) further explains that this is accomplished through the manipulation of
the syntactic style of the language, such as the use of pronouns and word order. As previously stated,
political discourse can be recognised either by the assertion of power, the resistance of power, or, on
the other hand, as a way to work together and resolve issues. The second notion, as a way to work
together to resolve issues, may seem to be more present within American political discourse, but power
is still present even if it is delivered in a way that a politician is trying to befriend the public. They often
use their political language in way that is trying to solve the nation’s problems (or whatever current
issue may be at hand) including all the while subtly maintaining their power through their use of
language.
This study aims to demonstrate this notion of ideology of power within the generic structuring of these
addresses, however, it is not the study’s main focus. The study recognises that power is present in the
addresses delivered by Obama. He is in a position of high social and political status and this
automatically places him in a position of authority, therefore, language is beneficial for him in
highlighting his causes, interests or ideas. Even though, this study recognises that power is present
within the addresses, the main focus is to demonstrate a functional approach to how meaning is made
within political discourse through the generic structure of the radio address. This research adds to the
previous work on power relations within political discourse through the lens of the functional linguistic
perspective by analysing the generic structures. The following section introduces some prominent
language features of political discourse.
2.3 Prominent Features of Political Discourse
There are many prominent features associated with political discourse. As mentioned, power in
language may be implicit and this section reviews some features that attribute to this implicit use of
power within the language of political discourse. A very prominent feature are metaphors (Partington
2003, 2006). Metaphors normally function when a word or a phrase is used as a comparison between
two ideas (Beard 2000: 19). Lakoff (1991: 1) states that “metaphorical thought is neither good nor bad;
it is simply commonplace and inescapable. Abstractions and enormously complex situations are
18
routinely understood via metaphor”. Specifically, regarding political discourse, Chilton (2004: 203) says
that metaphors of political discourse are not only ‘embellishments of literal propositions’ but ways of
reasoning, for instance, in regards to new policies or about the future. Thus, in one way metaphors can
be seen as a way to make complex ideas simpler for the listener, helping him/her understand ideas in
an easier way. Obama’s addresses regarding the economy or the health care were often broken down in
simplistic terms in order for the listener to understand the complex systems of both. As Chilton states, it
can be about new policies or the future and this is noted on the economy and health care as Obama
spoke about the new plans that he was trying to pass. An example of a metaphor is found in his first
sentence in his very first address as president in regards to the economy. He states: “We begin this year
and this Administration in the midst of an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented action”. Here
he states the crisis is calling for unprecedented action: this is a metaphor because a crisis cannot ‘call’
for action. A crisis is not a human agent that calls people to act.
Also, metaphors associated to war (Lakoff 2000) are often found in political discourse. For example, the
usage of such phrases as: ‘we will win the war on the economic crisis’, or ‘we will fight to bring jobs back
to the U.S.’. Metaphors of war bring a strong image within language by placing strong emphasis on what
one in power is trying to say. In addition, metaphors of war could be very provocative and could stir
listeners’ emotions. And, when emotions are stirred, people may then act or react in the way a politician
would like them to.
In addition to metaphors, pronouns are common in political discourse. Brown and Gilman (1960) first
showed how the use of pronouns affects the relationship between speaker and listener, and it can shift
the power to solidarity between two or more people (ibid. 1ff; Sornig 1989: 103). Pronouns may be
used to either foreground or to obscure the responsibility by demonstrating or not demonstrating the
social actor within a clause (Jones and Peccei 2004: 52). Social actors are participants in the clause,
usually the subject, and they can often be realised by pronouns (‘I’, ‘he’, ‘we’, ‘you’, etc) or also by nouns
(Fairclough 2003: 145).
Within political discourse, the pronoun ‘I’ realises a personal level, it may show authority, personal
commitment, and/or involvement. This pronoun brings distance between the speaker and audience
(Karapetjana 2011: 43; Bramley 2001: 259). The pronoun ‘We’ may be used for social collective
responsibility or a controversy. It may also be used to create a separation between ‘us’ and ‘them’ or
show unity of a particular group represented (Karapetjana 2011: 43; Bramley 2001: 260; De Fina 1995:
24). The pronoun ‘you’ is generic and may refer to anyone while ‘they’ may be used in political discourse
to divide people into particular groups (Bramley 2001: 261 -62). Below, in Figure 2.2, is an example
from Obama’s second address on health care and shows a shift in the use of pronouns in just six
sentences. By this constant switch of pronouns, he was able to strengthen his argument.
19
Meanwhile, pose one of the greatest threats to our federal
Medicare deficit, and could leave our children with a
and mountain of debt that they cannot pay.
Medicaid
We cannot continue down this path.
I do not accept a future where Americans forego
health care because they can’t pay for it, and more
and more families go without coverage at all.
And I don’t accept a future where American business is
hurt and our government goes broke.
We have a responsibility to act, and to act now.
That is why ‘m working with Congress to pass reform that
I’ lowers costs, improves quality and coverage, and
protects consumer health care choices.
Figure 2.2: Shift in the use of pronouns, 2nd health care address, sentences 9 - 14
In Figure 2.2, he begins with proper nouns as the subject, ‘Medicare and Medicaid’, which would be
‘they’ as a pronoun (3rd person plural), and he places them and divides them into groups and criticises
them. This is followed by the pronoun, ‘we’ (1st person plural), showing a social collective responsibility
by telling them not to continue this way. The next and the following clauses begin with ‘I’ (1st person
singular), where he is showing authority in asserting what he does not accept as well as a commitment
to American businesses. The next clause switches back to the pronoun ‘we’, showing social collective
responsibility for everyone to act (most likely meaning congress because of the following clause). In the
next clause, one again finds the pronoun ‘I’, where Obama is demonstrating his personal commitment
and involvement by working with congress.
Another device found in political discourse is the ‘rule of three’ (Jones and Peccei 2004). This is when
political speakers repeat themselves three times in order to place emphasis on the topic at hand. Often,
it usually appears as the subject within a clause, the Thematic position (explained in chapter three).
Two examples are offered below in Figure 2.3, Obama’s third economic address (taken from the data):
Jobs that upgrade classrooms and laboratories in 10,000
schools nationwide – at least 485 in Florida alone – and
train an army of teachers in math and science.
Jobs that modernize our health care system, not only saving
us billions of dollars, but countless lives.
Jobs that construct a smart electric grid, connect every corner
of the country to the information superhighway, double
our capacity to generate renewable energy, and grow
the economy of tomorrow.
Jobs that rebuild our crumbling roads, bridges and levees and
dams, so that the tragedies of New Orleans and
Minneapolis never happen again.
Figure 2.3: Example of the ‘rule of three’, from the 3rd economic address, sentences 25 - 28
20
In the figure, Obama uses the subject ‘Jobs’ four times to stress the fact of what these jobs will do. This is
in reference to ARRA, his recovery plan. These jobs will be the positive result of the plan, they will be
able to upgrade classrooms and laboratories, modernize the health care system, bring renewable
energy, and to rebuild crumbling roads, bridges and levees and dams. This can also be observed as a
metaphor for it is not a human agent that will bring about the changes, but it is the ‘jobs’ that will.
Immediately following this, in Figure 2.4, Obama uses the pronoun substitute ‘it’ three times with a
conjunction ‘and’ before the third ‘it’. By using ‘it’ three times, he places importance on the plan and
emphasises what the plan will do. He discusses that it brings tax relief, protects health insurance and
maintains jobs for teachers and nurses. Thus, the rule of three functions as a device for political
speakers to rely on by placing emphasis on issues that are of high priority to them. It is also a device as
a way for listeners to remember the most important points of a discourse.
It includes immediate tax relief for our struggling
middle class in places like Ohio, where 4.5 million
workers will receive a tax cut of up to $1,000.
It protects health insurance and provides
unemployment insurance for those who've lost
their jobs.
And it helps our states and communities avoid painful
tax hikes or layoffs for our teachers, nurses, and
first responders.
Figure 2.4: Example of the ‘rule of three’ from the 3rd economic address, sentences 29 – 31
One more prominent feature typically found in political discourse which expresses implicit meaning is
metonymy. Speakers can choose to make their meaning more explicit or more implicit. It is through
these choices that speakers “have to some degree (a) choice in how exactly they prompt their hearers to
construct the mental representations they would like (the listeners) to construct” (Chilton 2004: 61).
Metonymy is a notion of indirectly saying something connected to a certain lexical word, without
actually directly saying it; by choosing to do so, it affects the audience’s perception or attitude (Beard
2000:26). An example is the following: (a) ‘Buckingham Palace today denied claims that the royal family
is out of touch with the people’. Or (b) ‘The royal family today denied claims that they are out of touch
with the people’. The first example, (a), is the original and contains metonymy by replacing the ‘royal
family’ with ‘Buckingham Palace’. By using Buckingham Palace in the subject position, it does not place
the responsibility directly on the ‘royal family’ and thus keeps them indirectly out of the discussion.
Implicitly they are Buckingham Palace, but by doing this the reader/listener creates a different mental
picture (Beard 2000: 25). This is seen as well throughout the addresses of Obama. He often indirectly
places the blame on the republicans in Congress, since he is a democratic president. The following is
from his first address regarding the economic crisis, where he states:
21
Instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we
invest will be made public, and informed by independent experts whenever possible.
In the above example, he does not use any specific names nor any political affiliations, but instead uses
the broad term ‘politicians’ to get his idea across without directly pointing a finger, thus politicians
being the whole and republicans being a part of them. Another example is from his third address
regarding the reform of the health care, where he states:
[…] the same folks who controlled the White House and Congress for the past eight years as we
ran up record deficits will argue – believe it or not – that health reform will lead to record deficits.
In this example above, he uses ‘the same folks’ instead of saying the name of the president nor the
administration that controlled the White House during the eight years prior to his administration. It is
quite explicit, but nonetheless implicit for it does not explicitly state any names. These two examples
demonstrated metonymy and it is found in many types of political discourse. It creates another image in
the listener’s mind by not directly stating ‘names’ nor directly pinpointing specifics, but rather makes
general types of statements with implied meaning. The following section discusses some recent
research on genre and political discourse.
2.3.1 Recent Studies on Genre and Political Discourse
The previous sections discussed power and some features found within political discourse. This section
reviews some of the most recent works on the notion of genre and Political Discourse since this study
focuses on political discourse and the notion of genre. It reviews the genres of the following: political
interviews, campaigning on late night TV talk shows, blogging and an inaugural speech.
First, within the genre of political interviews, Fetzer & Bull (2013) research the broadcast of the
political interview. They combine a series of theories from ethnomethodological conversation analysis,
critical discourse analysis, social psychology and media studies. The study proposes that within political
interviews there are the default and non-default political interview. The default interview is the typical
interview: journalist asking political questions to a politician answering with political answers. Instead,
the non-default interview becomes blurred and draws on different semiotic codes and socio-cultural
codes as well as social-cultural practices. Their research suggests that political interviews can be
22
considered a ‘hybrid genre’ which may include both media communication and professional discourse,
in addition to the typical interview.
Secondly, Molek-Kozakowska (2013) investigates the genre of campaigning. She researches
campaigning on late night TV shows in the United States and how TV shows can accommodate to a
politician while s/he’s campaigning for the Presidency, such as Clinton and McCain. Examples of
‘accommodating’ techniques found included the talk shows’ tendency to use conventions that are
suitable for political aims of the candidate. Meaning, the talk show allows the candidate to combine the
interview with campaign strategies. She proposes that the late night talk show can be used in a
manipulative way by the campaigner through discursive practices for his or her own personal and
professional gains.
Thirdly, Kopytowska (2013) researches the structure and function of the genre of political blogs. She
defines this a somewhat new form of genre as “a meta-process transforming the relationship between
media, society and politics” by creating a common spatiotemporal, cognitive and axiological sphere of
experiences that are shared, and this is supplemented with social activities with virtual interaction that
were only previously possible in face to face communication (ibid: 379). In this research, she offers that
the genre of the political blog reduces the temporal, spatial, axiological, cognitive and emotional
distance between the blogger and his/her audience and creates this ‘mediation’ of experience by
creating a virtual world of communication. She offers a new combined theoretical approach to the
discourse of political blogospheres by combining pragmatic and cognitive linguistics with social
semiotics and media studies.
The three studies above research genre and political discourse, first from a political interview
perspective, from the perspective of genre and campaigning on late night talk shows, to finally the
genre of the blog. This final study of genre and political discourse is the only one that takes into
consideration the context of situation as well as the notion of generic structure as does this study, albeit
slightly. Gruber (2013) argues that genre analysis must investigate registers and discourse, thus, he
analyses the genre of inaugural speeches and presents some common features of generic definitions
that provide the basis for his theoretical investigation. He analyses the inaugural speeches of three
Austrian chancellors within the period of ten years and finds that the speeches did have similar
contextual features and somewhat similar generic structures even though the speakers came from
different political parties. However, he criticizes the work of Martin and Rose (2008) on genre from an
SFL point of view (2013: 34), stating “there is thus a sizable gap between situational context and
cultural context with no theoretical notion”. This thesis does not agree with his critique and argues that
the SFL perspective of genre does connect context and situation as well as viewing discourse in its
23
cultural context. This research demonstrates and argues that the SFL perspective of genre is an effective
tool to determine the generic structure of text in particular contexts of situation. This will be
demonstrated in the analysis of the four repertoires of Obama’s addresses and it will show that specific
contexts of situation are integral to understanding genre and generic structure (see chapters 5 -8).
2.4 Conclusion
This chapter introduced the notion of power and political discourse, particularly in relation to the fields
of critical discourse analysis (CDA) and political discourse analysis (PDA). It also highlighted prominent
features associated to political discourse such as metaphors, metaphor of war, pronouns, the rule of
three and metonymy. Thirdly, this chapter presented some of the most recent research in the field of
genre and political discourse from political interviews, campaigning on late night talk shows, and to the
genre of the blog. It also presented research by Gruber where he took into consideration context of
situation and the notion of generic structure, but not to the depth that this research investigates context
of situation and generic structure because he criticized the SFL perspective of genre. The following
chapter will discuss genre and the generic structure from the SFL perspective and introduce the system
of Theme/Rheme which is used as the tool to determine the generic structures.

Chapter 3
Genre, Generic Structuring and Theme/Rheme
3.1 Introduction
The previous chapter discussed studies within the field of political discourse. This chapter introduces
systemic functional linguistics (SFL), and then discuss genre, generic staging and Theme/Rheme. This
study finds that Theme/Rheme, part of the textual metafunction of SFL offers the most fruitful tool in
demonstrating the link between language and context and can reach the goals and the aims of this
research. Martin (1997: 4) explains SFL “is centrally concerned with showing how the organization of
language is related to its use. In SFL this concern is pursued by modelling both language and social
context as a semiotic system in relationship to realization with one another […], which is to say that
social context comprises patterns of language patterns.” Since this study has researched patterns within
the generic structures of Obama’s radio addresses, SFL deemed to be the most beneficial.
SFL is concerned with language and context of situation. This notion was developed by Firth (1957),
and SFL places itself strongly in this tradition (Bloor and Bloor 2004: 13). Context of situation is
revealed through the notion of register and its three variables: field, tenor, and mode. Martin (1997:10 -
12) states the following regarding field, tenor and mode:
“Field is concerned with systems of activity, including descriptions of the participants,
processes, and circumstances these activities involve. […] Tenor is concerned with social relations, as
these are the enacted through the dimensions of power and solidarity. […] (and) Mode is concerned
with semiotic distance, as this is affected by the various channels of communication through which we
undertake activity (field) and simultaneously enact social relations (tenor)”.
Field is what the text is about, tenor is who is taking part, and mode shows how the language is being
used. Context of situation, for example, could be a conversation between a professor and a student
speaking about an upcoming exam; a conversation between a mother and child, where the mother is
25
telling the child to clean her room; an email to a friend about concert tickets; or the context of situation
could be Presidential American Radio Address, where the President is speaking to the American people.
The last example could possibly be:
Context of Situation:
Field: what is going on? à A president speaking to the American people
Tenor: Who is taking part? à A president and American people
Mode: How is the language being used? à The language is written-to-be-spoken discourse
Figure 3.1 below (Miller 2017: 113) demonstrates the complex system of SFL from left to right. The
column on the reader’s left is the context of situation, which answers the questions of field, tenor, and
mode. Then this can be recognised in the semantics, middle column, by three different strands of
meaning through the metafunctions of SFL: field is realised by the ideational metafunction, tenor is
realized by the Interpersonal metafunction and mode is realised by the textual metafunction. Moreover,
each metafunction is realised at the lexico-grammar level, column on the right. At the lexico-grammar
level, the ideational metafunction is recognised as ‘Clause as Representation’ which involves
transitivity, the interpersonal metafunction is recognised as ‘Clause as Exchange’ which includes mood
(subject + finite) and modality and the textual metafunction is recognised as ‘Clause as Message’, which
includes the cohesion and textual structure of text. This study focuses on the textual metafunction, for it
was found to be beneficial to analyse language structure. Specifically, Theme/Rheme at the lexico-
grammar level because this metafunction focusses primarily on text structure.

This chapter focuses on Theme/Rheme within the textual metafunction of SFL, however before this, the
chapter discusses some slightly different perspectives on genre. It then discusses the SFL approach to
genre and register as well as the differing opinions regarding register and genre within the SFL
community. It then explains how genre is linked to the generic staging of a text and how then this can
be realized at the lexico-grammar level of Theme/Rheme:
Genre à Generic Staging à Theme/Rheme (lexico-grammar)
The following section discusses genre, SFL and genre, generic structuring and then Theme/Rheme is
explained in the final section.
3.2 Genre
Genre is a notion that has been widely researched and is interpreted in slightly different ways.
Generally, linguists may define genre as functioning according to social purpose, thus genre uses
language to meet different cultural tasks, and various genres are texts achieving various purposes
within a culture (Eggins and Martin 1997: 236). Many notions of genre draw from the work of Russian
literary theorist Bakhtin’s (1986) speech genres, where he established that utterances are individual
but each language develops its own ‘stable type’ of these utterances, which he called speech genres
(1986: 60). Each utterance that a person utters is connected to the (culture of) language in which one
speaks and in turn has its own expectations. Speaking of speech genre, Verschueren (2003: 49) believes
that according to this theory every human activity includes every aspect of communication “from an
intimate tete-à-tete to a battle field - shows essential links with wide range of utterances types”. He
further sees utterance types as “diverse as PARAPHRASE (which may go from simple turns in a
conversation to a fat book […]), which are relatively stable in terms of thematic content, linguistic style,
and compositional structure.” Genre can thus be viewed as “conventionalised or institutionalised
textual artefacts” that help one understand how members of certain discourse communities “construct,
interpret and use these genres to achieve their community goals” (Bhatia 2002: 6).
27
So, genre can be viewed as a communicative purpose within a certain context; as Swales (1990: 58)
states, it is comprised of:
class of communicative events, (that) the members of which share some set of communicative
purposes. These purposes are recognized by the expert members of the parent discourse community
and thereby constitute the rationale for the genre.
Within genre there are expected norms in which one speaks/writes/communicates within a certain
community, thus connecting to a certain type of genre within that community is vital in order to be
understood or accepted. Bondi (1999: 12) further explains that genres are “identified by their
communicative purpose, but they are also characterized by the structures that are conventionally
adopted by the specialist members of the professional or academic community”. This leads to the
notion of discourse community by Swales (1990). He states that that discourse communities share
discursive patterns and expectations to the extent that they “utilize one or more genre” (1990: 26).
Such genres (communicative events) are instrumental in furthering the goals of the communities.
There are many diverse discourse communities that have certain expectations and patterns that are
recognised genres within that community. Ventola (2000) has researched various types, such as legal
communities or bureaucratic communities. Interviews can be seen as a specific genre which is spoken
discourse, but then it may become a report which turns into written discourse, a different genre, which
has different expectations of the spoken interview. Another discourse community with a variety of
diverse expectations is the academic community. One example is academic writing, known as scientific
writing, and “it has a specific purpose and an ultimate goal […], the purpose may be to complete a
Master’s thesis, a Doctoral thesis, present a conference paper or an article for publication” (Kunst 2012:
222). So, in the academic discourse community alone there are various types of genres: theses,
abstracts, conference presentations, journal articles. Regarding academic writing, Gillet (2012) states
that it “is a social practice”; he explains it is social because one does not do it alone in the sense that the
author always needs to consider the audience/reader. Swales and Feat (2009: 7) explain that the
academic writer always needs to consider the audience that will read the text, the purpose of the text,
the organization as well as the style, flow and presentation. There has been much research done in this
area, such as the research article and scientific discourse (Ventola 1991, Duszak 1997, Bondi 1999), as
well as cultural differences when it comes to certain genres (Mauranen 1994). Thus, academic writing
is one example of a discourse community, however there are many more and they all have expectations
within their community which includes: the style, the flow, and the organisation.
28
There are different and slight variations on the notion of genre in general. For instance, there is the new
rhetoric understanding of genre in North America (Bazerman 1988; Berkenkotter and Huckin 1995;
Freedman and Medway 1994). They originated their work by combining research from classical
rhetoric, literary studies, and communication studies, and view genre as purposeful and ‘typified’ social
actions (Gruber 2013: 31). Cap and Okulska (2013: 1) explain genre similarly, stating genre is an
“intuitive notion” that involves common sense where utterances are quite stable within groupings and
that they follow “patterns” in order to accomplish specific goals. Fairclough (2003: 65) views genre as
“discoursal aspect of ways of acting and interacting” within different social events. Further, he adopts
the notion of three metafunctions from SFL, but changes the name for his own research; he states
(2003: 66), “I shall also view texts as multi-functional in this sort of sense, though in a rather different
way, in accordance with the distinction between genres, discourse and styles as the three main ways in
which discourse figure as a part of social practice – ways of acting, ways of representing, ways of being”.
The next section discusses genre and SFL.
3.3. Genre and Systemic Functional Linguistics
This study takes the viewpoint that genre and register are inherently connected. However, there are
differing perspectives in SFL when it comes to the notion of register (field, tenor, mode) and genre.
Halliday’s theory on register is ‘register minus genre’ (Lukin 2008; Miller 2017). Halliday, MacIntosh
and Strevens (1964) first understood register as a variety of choices that each speaker has to choose
from at various times. Register is then defined by Halliday (Halliday and Hasan 1985/89) as “variation
according to use”. Thompson (2004: 40) further explains it as “certain recognizable configurations of
linguistic resources in certain texts”. Miller (2017: 16) explains register as being “a typical
conglomeration in speakers selections in meanings/wordings due to a typical combination of
contextual variables”. Register then can be viewed as capturing perspectives of language defined by
different situations in which the speaker/writer chooses (Taboada 2011: 247). Halliday (2009: 243)
expresses that culture is also a central part of these choices, for they are a “social-semiotic system:
network of social semiotic features constituting the systems and processes of the cultures, defined as
potential clusters of values of field, tenor, mode”. The context of culture plays a large role in the
variation of register that is produced; Miller (2017: 17) states that “even a slight fine-tuning to any
relevant contextual variable in a CC (context of culture) will make a difference to the concrete text being
produced”. Both context of situation and context of culture play a vital role within register. As
mentioned, there are differing opinions in SFL regarding the connection between register and genre.
This study adopts the view from the Sydney School of SFL, explained below, that genre is on a higher
level of register which was developed by Martin. Martin viewed Halliday’s model as limited, thus added
the higher plane of genre above register, however some disagree with this approach and see Halliday’s
29
model as quite satisfactory (Miller 2017). This study’s aim is not to further discuss the details of the
debate, but suggest to see Miller 2017 for a clearer understanding regarding these differences.
To briefly mention, there are a couple of genre theories that are somewhat connected to SFL that this
study decided not to use. First, rhetorical structure theory (RST), developed in 1983 by Mann,
Thompson and Matthiessen1, offers to explain the coherence and description of texts rather than
creating or understanding them. The author found that this theory did not offer the tools necessary for
the analysis of this study and also found it to be a bit complex. The second theory, register and genre
theory (R&GT), was developed by Eggins and Martin (1997). They developed a three-step analysis of
genre and register which included: 1) textual formality, 2) expression of attitude, and 3) assumed
knowledge. Again, the author found that this theory investigated more than just the generic structure,
thus did not offer the tools required for this study’s aims and purposes.
Thompson (2004: 42 – 43) views genre as register plus genre and creates an image to express the
connection; he states (ibid: 43):
the difference between register and genre is to see register as cloth and genre as garment: the
garment is made of an appropriate type of cloth or cloths, cut and shaped in conventional ways to suit
particular purposes. Similarly, a genre deploys the resources of register […] in particular patterns to
achieve certain communicative goals.
This study then views genre as being connected to register on a higher level, then below register is field,
tenor and mode, and below each the corresponding metafunction, as seen in Figure 3.2:

Eggins (2004), Eggins and Slade (2006), Martin and Rose (2007; 2008), Coffin et al (2009). Where,
within their understanding of SFL, genre is viewed at a higher level than the metafunctions (ideational,

interpersonal, textual). It is seen as the social process in more holistic terms. Martin (1997: 6) explains
genre as:
a special focus on the stages through which most texts unfold. The relation of genre to register
(context of situation) as complementary perspectives on the social ‘content’ of language (i.e. context) is
thus comparable in some respects to the relation of discourse semantics to lexico-grammar as
complementary perspectives on language’s own content plane.
Genre is directly related to the staging and the lexico-grammar within the cultural context of situation
in which it is produced. And this study investigates the notion of the sub-genre within an established
genre, it can be recognised as part of an overall genre, but functions with a more specific goal and
purpose.
As stated previously, there are many different types of genre: greetings, cards, service encounters,
casual conversations, arguments, telephone enquiries, instructions, lectures, debates, plays, jokes,
games (Martin and Rose 2007: 8). The academic discourse community alone includes different types of
genres: journal articles, conference presentations, or theses. In each various type of genre, there is an
expected cultural formula to follow to reach the expected end result. As mentioned, this study
interprets genre as sociocultural because it usually involves other people with the same cultural ‘norms’
and it has specific goals in mind to accomplish which require different stages to go through in order to
reach the specific goal (Martin 1984: 25). Genre can be further elaborated as “a staged, goal-oriented
social process. Social because we participate in genres with other people; goal-oriented because we use
genres to get things done; staged because it usually takes us a few steps to reach our goals” (Martin &
Rose 2007: 8). Eggins and Slade (2006: 56) further elaborate on Martin’s explanation of genre as the
following:
Social process: genres are negotiated interactively and are realization of a social purpose
Goal oriented: a genre is goal oriented in that texts typically move through stages to a point of
closure, and are considered incomplete if the culmination is not reached.
Staged: a genre is staged as the meanings are made in steps; it usually takes more than one step
for participants to achieve their goals.
Genre involves a social process, that both involves interactivity and a social purpose. It is realized
within the social and cultural context in which it is produced. For example, a speech given by President
Obama is produced for the social purposes within the context of American society, and this would not
function in another context, for example, the genre of American presidential speeches would not fit into
the social context of an Italian presidential speech for an Italian audience. Further, within the social
purpose, there are specific goals of each speech. Every text produced intends to reach a specific goal, be
31
it a text message, a phone call, an email or a speech given by a president. Within presidential speeches,
the goal varies according to the speech given. As was mentioned, there are four different repertoires of
the radio address delivered by Obama, and within each grouping the goal of the radio address was
different. He had a different goal for the addresses on the economy when compared to the goal of his
Christmas addresses or to that of health care. Thus, with each of these varied goals and specific
purposes in these different addresses can be observed as a sub-genre under the umbrella genre of the
radio address. The last feature of genre is staging: in order for the goal to be achieved, the text needs to
take steps in order to reach the goal. A simplistic example of staging of a speech would be: introduction,
body, conclusion (this will be discussed further in the section on generic staging).
This is the notion of genre used in this research. The genre of this study is the presidential American
radio address within the context of American culture, see below. Furthermore, the social process is
Obama interactively negotiating through this genre with the American people or Congress. Each of his
addresses were goal oriented, meaning that there was a specific goal that he wants to reach through
any address delivered. It could either be asking the American people to help the military and their
families or asking them to pray for those affected by a tragedy. There may also be multiple goals within
an address, for example, he may want to wish the American public a Merry Christmas, while asking
them to help the military. Or he may be asking the public to pray for those affected by a tragedy, while
informing them of the events that transpired. These goals are reached in each address by stages it
moves through in order to reach the intended outcome. The following section will discuss generic
structuring.
Genre: American Presidential Radio Address
Social process: Obama is negotiating interactively through this genre with the American
people, as well as with a social purpose
Goal oriented: Each of his addresses is goal oriented, meaning that there is a specific goal that
he wants to reach through any specific address delivered
Staged: Each address has stages that it moves through in order for the intended goal to be
reached.
3.4 From Genre to Generic Staging
A very basic perspective of generic structuring is texts as having a beginning, middle and an end (Eggins
1994; Stenström 1994). Martin (1992: 500) explains that it is “the way texts typically move through
stages to a point of closure.” Further, Coffin et al (2010: 252) state:
32
its unfolding organization can be more usefully viewed from a functional perspective. (This)
provides insight into how different genres enable language users to achieve their social purposes by
moving through distinct functional stages. For example, the beginning stage of a narrative provides
orientation to a time and place, while the beginning of a discussion genre sets out a controversial issue.
Some types of genre were already mentioned and each uniquely unfold in order to reach their goal. For
example, a basic greeting may be:
(1) Opening salutation à (2) inquiring how the person is à (3) Closing salutation
The study uses the term ‘moves’ for connecting the various stages that are involved in a generic
structure. As Coffin et al (2010: 259) say, “we have examined eight different genres and examined some
of the stages that language users move through in pursuit of their social purposes” and, as Martin (1992:
500) stated above, generic structure is “the way texts typically move through stages to a point of
closure” (italics by author).
The notion of generic moves within spoken/written genre was demonstrated above with three possible
moves of a greeting. It can also be compared to a theatrical play. The actors literally do move through
the acts in order to reach the end and the final act, which is the ultimate goal of a play. As the audience
is watching, they witness the play unfold as the actors move through the various acts and thus are able
to coherently understand the social purpose and goal of the play. For example, Shakespeare’s Romeo
and Juliet (Shakespeare/Holderness 1990) has five acts and within each act there are different scenes.
In the first act, scene one begins in a public place in Verona, Italy, and in the last scene, act 5 ends in the
house of the Capulets. Thus, the plays progresses and unfolds until the final scene and the final act,
scene 5, in a tomb at a graveyard of a church. In order to get from the beginning of the play in a public
place in Verona to the final scene in a tomb, the actors need to go through each of the scenes within
each act, and physically act and move through the scenes to achieve the final purpose and goal.
Within generic moves of written/spoken genres, a rhetorical pattern may be found in order to help the
text reach its intended goal. Some generic moves within a text may be a description, definition,
exemplification, classification, comparison, contrast, cause & effect, amongst others (Hoey 1983).
Martin & Rose (2007: 10) explain that “The stages of genre are relatively stable components of its
organization, that we can recognize in some form in instance after instance of the genre [...].” Some
examples of generic moves, demonstrating the ‘unfolding of organization’ are: an abstract (Swales and
Feak 2009) indicating 11 moves beginning with a reference to established knowledge and the final move
33
ending with prompting further research, or a service encounter, which Ventola (1987) shows can be
accomplished in five moves:
(1) opening greeting à (2) customer asking for goods à (3) the salesperson giving the customer the
goods à (4) the customer paying à (5) closing greeting
More examples can be observed in a biographical recount, a narrative and a procedure (Coffin et al
2010: 260). First, a biographical recount serves the purpose of retelling the events of a person’s life and
according to Coffin et al can be accomplished in three general moves:
(1) orientation à (2) record of events à (3) evaluation of person
Further, a narrative has the aim of telling a story and can be accomplished in the following four general
moves:
(1) orientation à (2) complication à (3) evaluation à (4) resolution
And finally, a procedure serves the purpose of giving instructions, such as with a recipe and can be
observed in three general possible moves:
(1) goal à (2) material à (3) steps
Therefore, this study analysed possible generic moves to reveal how Obama moved through the stages
of the various repertoires to achieve said purpose and said goal. The study aimed to move away from
the more general moves and reveal moves in a more specified way according to context of situation. For
example, below are the generic moves of his first address regarding the economy. There were seven
generic stages that he ‘moved’ through in order to reach his goal and purpose. First, there was the
introduction, then Obama spoke about his recovery plan to stimulate the economy (ARRA), in the third
move, he continued to speak about the recovery plan, in the fourth move he spoke about the opposition
of the plan, in the fifth move, he introduced a website for Americans to find out more information about
ARRA, in the sixth move, he stressed the urgency to act now, and the seventh move, was the conclusion:
(1) Introduction à (2) Economic recovery plan à (3) Economic recovery plan à (4) The Opposition
against plan à (5) A new website for more information about the plan à (6) Need to act now à
(7) Conclusion
34
The following section discusses Theme/Rheme, part of the textual metafunction of SFL, which was used
to determine the generic moves of the data.
3.5 Theme/Rheme
The previous sections introduced SFL as well as genre and generic structure. It was established that it is
through three different strands of meaning, the three metafunctions of SFL, that the lexico-grammar is
realized. The ideational metafunction is recognised as ‘Clause as Representation’ which involves
transitivity, the interpersonal metafunction is recognised as ‘Clause as Exchange’ which includes mood
(subject + finite) and modality and the textual metafunction is recognised as ‘Clause as Message’, which
involves the cohesion and textual structure of text. It is through these three strands of meaning that the
richness of language is revealed, as Eggins and Slade (2006: 48) state:
The systemic model is rich in analytical techniques, allowing the analyst to focus on
those patterns which are most relevant to specific data and research interests. […] The richness
of the model, however, necessitates a careful delimiting of analytical focus. One of the most
powerful aspects of the systemic approach is that language is viewed as a resource for making
not just one meaning at a time but several strands of meaning simultaneously. The simultaneous
layers of meaning can be identified in linguistic units of all sizes: in the word, phrase, clause,
sentence, and text.
This section first briefly explains the ideational and interpersonal metafunctions. Then, the remainder
of this section discusses Theme/Rheme, part of the textual metafunction, which plays an integral role in
this work.
3.5.1 The Ideational and Interpersonal Metafunctions
The ideational and interpersonal metafunction are both represented in the Theme/Rheme. They will be
only briefly introduced here to establish an understanding of each for they are rich and complex
systems in themselves. First, the ideational metafunction, ‘clause as representation’, answers the
question ‘what is going on?’, this is seen at the experiential level, basically how one is experiencing the
world and the context of situation that they are involved in. Thompson states (2004: 86), “language
reflects our view of the world as consisting of ‘going-ons’ (verbs) involving things (nouns) which may
have attributes (adjectives) and which go on against background details of place, time, manner, etc.
(adverbials)”. Within this metafunction, it is comprised of the verbs (transitivity) as well as the
participants that are involved with the verbal processes, as well as circumstance. Eggins (2004:206)
states that “transitivity (relates) to the dimensions of Field, with the choice process types and
participant roles seen as realizing interactants’ encoding of their experiential reality: the world of
35
actions, relations, participants, and circumstances that give content to their talk.” This metafunction is a
complex system and Transitivity involves many different process types such as material, mental, verbal,
behavioral, relational and existential. Furthermore, circumstance involves the circumstantial elements
that one realizes, such as time, manner, location, agent and extent. This is further explained in the
Theme/Rheme section.
The Interpersonal Metafunction, ‘clause as exchange’, answers the question ‘who is taking part?’ This
metafunction is concerned with the interaction of the participants involved in a discourse, therefore the
grammar of the clauses is attributed to the exchange of the interactants (Thompson 2004: 45). The
lexico-grammar of the interpersonal metafunction is realized through mood, modality and adjuncts.
First, mood involves the subject and the finite, and the subject + finite attributes to the ‘mood’ created
in a discourse, especially conversational discourse. It is what one chooses as the subject and the finite
that will then have an influence of how a conversation unfolds. Secondly, modality has two different
types, modalization (information) and modulation (goods-and-services). Modalization involves
‘probability’ or ‘usuality’; Thompson states (2004: 67), “the modality relates to how valid the
information is being presented as in terms of probability (how likely it is to be true) or usuality (how
frequently it is true).” Modulation involves ‘obligation’ or ‘inclination’, such as in commands, how much
is one obligated to follow through with the command, and inclination has to do with how much one is
inclined with offers. The interpersonal metafunction contains adjuncts, mood adjuncts, comment
adjuncts and vocative adjuncts, they are “clause constituents (that) add interpersonal meaning to the
clause” (Eggins and Slade 2006: 160). Mood adjuncts are for example: probably, maybe, usually, always
and sometimes; comment adjuncts are for example: frankly, unfortunately, honestly and understandably;
vocative adjuncts are recognised by a name, proper nouns. These adjuncts play an important role in
Thematic analysis and is further explained below in the section of Theme/Rheme.
3.5.2 The Textual Metafunction: Theme/Rheme
As previously introduced, the ideational metafunction answers the question ‘what is going on?’, the
interpersonal metafunction answers the question ‘who is taking part?’, thus the textual metafunction,
‘clause as message’ answers the question ‘how is the language being used?’. The textual metafunction is
concerned at the lexico-grammar level on how a text is organized, structured and ‘held’ together. This
metafunction involves reference, conjunctions, cohesiveness as well as Thematic structure.
3.5.2.1 The Theme System
36
The previous sections introduced genre and generic structure from a systemic functional perspective.
They are important notions in this study, for this study focuses on the genre of the radio address and
the four various repertoires of registers within this genre. Each of the three metafunctions (three
strands of meaning), ideational, interpersonal and textual, were briefly introduced; it is through these
metafunctions that genre and register are realized at the lexico-grammar level. This section focuses
then on the system of Theme/Rheme (part of the textual strand of meaning). It is important to
understand the notion of Theme and Rheme, as it was used as the analytical tool to determine the
generic structures.
This section explains Theme/Rheme and why it is a beneficial tool to determine generic structure.
Secondly, Theme as it is expressed through the metafunctions is introduced. For instance, Topical
Theme expresses the ideational/experiential metafunction, the interpersonal Theme expresses the
interpersonal metafunction, and the textual Theme expresses the textual metafunction as Theme.
Additionally, multiple Theme is discussed: it is when more than one Theme is expressed within a clause,
for example one clause may contain a textual Theme, an interpersonal Theme and a Topical Theme.
Finally, other types of Theme are introduced that are not directly connected to the metafunctions:
interrogatives, including Yes/No, WH questions, and elliptical interrogatives, imperatives, exclamatives,
existential process, demonstratives and predicated Theme.
3.5.2.2 What is Theme and Rheme?
Theme and Rheme is part of the textual metafunction of SFL, which the textual metafunction (clause a
message) is concerned about the overall organization of the text (cohesion, coherence, and texture).
Simply, Theme is the first part of a clause, everything that precedes the process of a clause (Eggins
2004: 324). An example can be seen below in the clause “We begin this year and this Administration in
the midst of an unprecedented crisis.” (E1:1):
We begin this year and this Administration in the
midst of an unprecedented crisis.
Theme (Topical/unmarked) Rheme
In this very first sentence of Obama’s very first radio address regarding the economy, the Theme is ‘We’
(Topical unmarked Theme), followed by the verb ‘begin’ and the rest of the clause which is then
considered to be Rheme. Whereas there are varying viewpoints within the field of SFL on whether or
not the Subject should be included as part of Theme, this study takes the stance that it should be
included, for it believes the subject is quite significant in terms of its relevance within the Thematic
structure.
37
Therefore, Theme is what the speaker chooses as the start of a message or clause (Lipson 2006: 147),
and Bloor and Bloor (2004: 71) support this by saying that Theme is “the idea represented by the
constituent at the starting point of the clause”. In the above example, Obama chose to begin the clause
with ‘we’ as the starting point of his first address. By choosing this as Theme, he is including everyone,
‘we’, it could possibly be ‘we’ as ‘the administration’, the ‘the government’, or ‘we’ as ‘the nation’, but in
any case it is an inclusive subject that has a powerful impact as a start of his discourse, for no one is
excluded. Thus, Theme is defined as the “element which serves the starting point for the message: it is
what the clause is going to be about” (Halliday 1994: 38; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004: 64). In the
above example, the clause is about ‘we’, ‘we the people of the nation’ or ‘we the government’. Theme is
what is chosen by the writer/speaker as the point of departure for a clause; “clause begins with the
realization of the Theme” (Bloor and Bloor 2004: 71), and then Rheme is the rest of the clause, “this is
followed by the realization of the Rheme” (ibid). Thompson (2004: 165) clearly expresses the Rheme as
“provid(ing) the content, the main information that the writer or speaker wants the addressee to
know”. In the above example, the Rheme is: begin this year and this Administration in the midst of an
unprecedented crisis. Obama thus wanted to inform the American people about the condition he was
beginning his administration. Halliday (2009: 167) sums up the Theme system in the following way: the
“Theme system is a system of the clause, where it sets up a structural pattern that we can interpret as a
configuration of the functions Theme and Rheme”. Thus, the Theme of a clause is the point of departure
that the speaker/writer chooses to orient the listener/speaker within its specific context and the rest of
the message is then developed in and known as the Rheme (Halliday and Matthiessen 2004: 64).
3.5.2.3 Theme as a tool to reveal generic structure
Theme contributes to the flow of text, Eggins (2004: 324) states: “Theme makes to the cohesion, and
coherence of a text has to do with how Thematic elements succeed each other”, thus Theme
demonstrates the connectedness of text (or lack thereof). This was seen with the data. Each address
demonstrated connectedness, or the lack of connectedness, which in turn showed a new starting point
within Obama’s address. This then signaled a change and a new generic move. Theme gives the clause
its character as a message, it reveals the flow of the message and what the speaker/writer decides to
place at the beginning, and by doing so places particular emphasis on it. So, “the Thematic organization
of the clauses […] is the most significant factor in the development of text” (Halliday & Matthiessen
2004: 105). This is further supported by Eggins (2004: 320), who says that “Thematic choices realize
meanings about the organization of the communicative event”. Moreover, Thompson (2004: 165)
clearly explains why Theme/Rheme analysis is beneficial to this research by explaining the four
functions of Theme:
38
“I generally find that Theme starts to make sense once you examine it in terms of how Theme
choices work together through a text to signal its underlying coherence, and to signal its ‘method of
development’, in Fries’ term. Very broadly, it is possible to identify four main, related functions:
1) Signalling the maintenance or progression of ‘what the text is about’ at that point. This is
especially done through the choice of subject as unmarked Theme: maintenance is conducted by
keeping to the same Theme as the preceding clause, progression often by selecting a constituent
from the proceeding Rheme.
2) Specifying or changing the framework for the interpretation of the following clause (or clauses)
– wording here is taken from Fries (1995). This is mostly carried out by the choice of marked
Theme, especially adjunct or clause, or by including textual or interpersonal elements in Theme.
A ‘heavy’ Subject Theme, giving a large amount of information, can also be used for this purpose.
3) Signalling the boundaries of the sections in the text. This is often effected by changing from one
type of Theme choice to another. In many cases, there may be a number of successive Themes
(typically three – a ’thematic triplet’) of different types: for example, a summative Theme (e.g.
‘All this’), followed by one that signals a change of framework, followed by one which signals the
start of a new framework.
4) Signalling what the speaker thinks is viable/useful/important starting point. This is done by
repeatedly choosing the same element to appear in Theme (a particular participant, the
speaker’s evaluation, elements which signal interaction with the hearer, etc).”
So, from the point of view of generic moves, this study found that Thematic analysis was the most useful
in determining the changes between moves of the radio addresses, for Thematic analysis can signal the
maintenance or progression of a text, it is able to specify or change the framework within a text, it
signals the boundaries of sections within a text, and it is also able to demonstrate what the speaker
thinks is important by showing what he/she places in the Thematic position. The following section
discusses unmarked and marked Themes.
3.5.2.4 Unmarked and Marked Themes
Within Theme and Rheme analysis there are two significant Theme types that need to be understood,
unmarked Theme and marked Theme. This section discusses and defines unmarked and marked
Themes as well as gives examples. It is important to differentiate between these at this point so that
when the other types of Theme are discussed later in this chapter, the reader will already be aware of
this distinction between these Theme types as well as its significance. First, unmarked Theme is
defined, then marked Theme is discussed, and finally the importance of understanding unmarked and
marked Theme is explained.
39
First, an un-marked Theme is when the subject and the Theme conflate, which means that the actual
subject of a clause is functioning as the Theme. Below are some examples that show this:
un-Marked Theme in Declarative Clauses:
We begin this year and this administration in the midst of
an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented
action (E1A,1S)
They don’t expect Democratic solutions or Republican
solutions – they expect American solutions. (E3,20S)
Congress has passed my economic recovery plan – an
ambitious plan at a time we badly need it. (E4A,7S)
THEME RHEME
Within unmarked Theme, they also, of course, include nominal groups as subject, as Halliday and
Matthiessen (2004: 73) state, “then comes other nominal groups – those with a common noun or
proper as Head – and nominalizations. Providing these are functioning as a subject, then having them as
Theme still the unmarked choice.” This is demonstrated with the examples below:
unmarked Theme with nominal groups
No one bill, no matter how can cure what ails our economy. (E2A,25S)
comprehensive
The road to recovery demands that we will act responsibly, from Main
Street to Washington to Wall Street.
Theme Rheme
Secondly, marked Theme is when the subject and the Theme in a clause do not conflate, in other words
the actual subject of a clause does not come first in the Thematic structure. The “Theme (may) conflate
with any other constituent from the Mood system” (Eggins 2004: 318) or another common type is an
adjunct such as a conjunction or a comment adjunct. Halliday and Matthiessen (2004: 73) state that “the
most usual form of marked Theme is an adverbial group, such as today, suddenly, somewhat distractedly,
or a prepositional phrase, for example at night, in the corner, without any warning functioning as
Adjunct in the clause.” Using the same examples above, but now they are demonstrated as marked
Theme: the first example: In America – circumstance of location followed by the subject we; the second
example, And - a paratactic conjunction followed by the subject they; the third example, Fortunately – a
comment adjunct followed by the subject Congress:
40
Marked Theme in Declarative Clauses:
In America, begin this year and this administration in the midst of
We an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented
action (E1A,1S)
And, they don’t expect Democratic solutions or Republican
solutions – they expect American solutions. (E3,20S)
Fortunately, has passed my economic recovery plan – an
Congress ambitious plan at a time we badly need it. (E4A,7S)
THEME RHEME
The following sections show how Theme is expressed through the three metafunctions of SFL, the
ideational, interpersonal and textual.
3.6 Ideational, Interpersonal and Textual expressed as Theme
This section discusses how Theme is expressed through the three strands of meaning expressed
through the three metafunctions of SFL: Ideational also recognised as experiential, interpersonal, and
textual. Theme is analysed as expressing experiential meaning, interpersonal meaning and textual
meaning, and this system is a complex system, thus this section will demonstrate the types of Theme
that was most commonly found in the analysis. First, the Ideational/Experiential metafunction is
expressed as Topical Theme. The Interpersonal metafunction can function as Theme via the following
three ways: (1) Mood Adjuncts, (2) Vocative Adjuncts; (3) Comment Adjuncts. There are other types of
adjuncts within the interpersonal Theme, however, these are the three that were found as the result of
the analysis, and they are the most common types. The Textual metafunction functions as Theme in the
two following ways: (1) Continuity Adjuncts and (2) Conjunctive Adjuncts. Figure 3.3, shows the
adjuncts in relation to each metafunction.

Figure 3.3 Adjuncts in relation to metafunctions (adapted from HM 2004: 79)
3.6.1 Theme expressing Experiential as Topical Theme
41
The ideational/experiential metafunction is expressed as Topical Theme in the Thematic structure.
Topical theme is determined when “an element of the clause to which a Transivity function can be
assigned occurs in the first position in a clause” (Eggins 2004:301). It involves participants (normally
the Subject), circumstances and processes. Once the topical theme has been determined, the rest of the
clause remains in the Rheme (Eggins 2004: 302), and this study includes the subject as part of the
Theme as was mentioned above.
Therefore, topical Theme is either recognised as the subject, seen in the previous examples, or
unmarked Theme as now seen here. These examples can be recognised as Topical unmarked Theme:
Topical un-Marked Theme
We begin this year and this administration in the midst of
an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented
action (E1A,1S)
They don’t expect Democratic solutions or Republican
solutions – they expect American solutions. (E3,20S)
Congress has passed my economic recovery plan – an
ambitious plan at a time we badly need it. (E4A,7S)
THEME RHEME
Topical Theme becomes marked Theme when a circumstantial adjunct comes before the subject, and
the subject follows the circumstantial adjunct or any of the other adjuncts that will be introduced in this
section. Eggins says (2004: 159), “Circumstantial Adjuncts add ideational content to the clause, by
expressing some circumstance relating to the process represented in the clause”. Thus, circumstance is
expressed through circumstance of time, location (where), cause (why), matter (about what), agent (by
whom) (Halliday and Matthiessen 2004: 355). Some examples are demonstrated below that show
Topical Marked Theme: the first shows circumstance of time: Today; the second shows circumstance of
matter: About the crisis; and the last shows circumstance of location: In Washington:
Topical Marked Theme

the midst of an unprecedented crisis that

THEME RHEME
Therefore, the ideational metafunction expresses Topical Theme and it is most commonly expressed by
a participant, a subject, which is then a topical unmarked Theme, or by a circumstantial element, which
it is then topical marked Theme.
3.6.2 Theme expressing as Interpersonal Theme
The Interpersonal metafunction establishes a relationship between the speaker and the listener, it is
very important in this study because it demonstrated when Obama was trying to connect to the
American people through interpersonal Theme. In the Thematic analysis, interpersonal Theme is
expressed through mood adjuncts, vocative adjuncts, and comment adjuncts (discussed below). There
are other types of adjuncts within the interpersonal Theme, however, these are the three that were
found as the result of the analysis, and are the most common types. Eggins states (2004: 302) that
“when a constituent to which we would assign a Mood label (but not a transitivity label) occurs at the
beginning of a clause, we call it interpersonal Theme.” Moreover, she states (ibid: 160) that
interpersonal Themes are:
clause constituents which add interpersonal meaning to the clause. That is, they add meanings
which are somehow connected to the creation and maintenance of the dialogue. They can do this either
by impacting directly on the Mood element or indirectly, by merely adding an expression of attitude or
making an attempt to direct the interaction itself.
Interpersonal Theme can be identified as a Thematic element through the following types of adjuncts.
3.6.2.1 Mood Adjuncts
Mood adjuncts are related to the modal operators, what they add to the Thematic structure is the ability
to add some judgment or the likelihood or probability to a proposition. And when they appear before
the subject, they are then part of the Thematic structure. The Theme will then be considered marked
Theme for the subject would not conflate with the Theme. The following are the most common
expressions of mood (Eggins 2004: 160):
i) expressions of probability: perhaps, maybe, probably
ii) expressions of usuality: sometimes, usually
43
iii) expressions of intensification or minimization: really, absolutely, just, somewhat
iv) expressions of presumption: evidently, presumably, obviously
v) expressions of inclination: happily, willingly
The examples below demonstrate how adjuncts of mood could be placed in the Thematic structure. The
first example shows the expression of intensification or minimization with absolutely; the second
example shows the Expression of probability with probably; and the third example shows the
expression of presumption with evidently:
Marked Theme with Mood adjuncts: Interpersonal Theme
Absolutely, We begin this year and this administration in
the midst of an unprecedented crisis that

THEME RHEME
3.6.2.2 Vocative Adjuncts
A vocative Adjunct is usually a proper noun, using someone’s name or the name of a country, for
example, in the thematic structure. When they appear before the first topical Theme in a clause, they
are considered to be interpersonal Theme for they contribute interpersonal meaning into the clause
(Eggins 2004: 304). Moreover, Eggins explains (ibid: 162) them as the following:
vocative Adjuncts function to control the discourse by designating a likely ‘next speaker’. They
are identifiable as names, where the names are not functioning as Subjects or Complements, but are
used to directly address the person named. […] They typically occur either initially or finally, although
they may occur as a variety different constituent boundaries in the clause.
Below are two possible types of vocative adjunct, the first example shows America functioning as the
interpersonal Theme with a vocative adjunct in the Thematic position and the second one demonstrates
a person’s name, John.
44

the midst of an unprecedented crisis that
calls for unprecedented action

Republican solutions – they expect
American solutions.
Vocative adjunct
THEME RHEME
3.6.2.3 Comment Adjuncts
Comment adjuncts in the Thematic structure are a comment that is stated within the Interpersonal
thematic structure preceding the subject of the clause. They are an integral part of interpersonal
Theme, since they explicitly expresses one’s opinion within a text and are recognised as interpersonal,
inserting one’s voice within the text. Comment Adjuncts are not as closely connected to mood, they
function in propositions, and they tend to express one’s opinion to the whole proposition. According to
Eggins (2004: 161), “comment Adjuncts function to express an assessment about the clause as a whole.
(They) typically occur in clause initial position, or directly after the Subject, and are realized by adverbs.
(They) are considered interpersonal elements in the clause, since they add an expression of attitude
and evaluation.” Therefore, when there is a comment adjunct before the topical Theme, it is then
analysed as an interpersonal Theme and is considered marked Theme.
A list of common comment adjuncts is the following (Halliday 1994: 49), and are identified in the
following distinctions: admission, assertion, how desirable, how constant, how valid, how sensible or
how expected:
- admission: frankly
- assertion: honestly, really
- how desirable: luckily, hopefully
- how constant: tentatively, provisionally
- how valid: broadly speaking, generally
- how sensible: understandably, wisely
- how expected: as expected, amazingly
45
The three examples below demonstrate comment adjuncts in the Thematic position, the first, frankly,
demonstrating admission; the second, broadly speaking, demonstrating how valid; and the third, luckily,
demonstrating how desirable:
Marked Theme with comment adjuncts: Interpersonal theme
Frankly, we begin this year and this administration in
the midst of an unprecedented crisis that
calls for unprecedented action

Republican solutions – they expect
American solutions.

an ambitious plan at a time we badly
need it.

THEME RHEME
3.6.3 Theme expressing Textual Theme
Textual Theme does not express experiential meaning, nor does it express interpersonal meaning, but
instead it functions as a cohesive element in relation to the content of the text. It works as a way to
connect meanings within text, and to connect previously stated clauses. Textual Theme helps create
unity within text and helps with the overall structure. This type of Theme has very limited choice in the
position in the text, meaning they usually will be found in the first position of a clause. Eggins explains
(2004: 305) that “these are elements which do not express any interpersonal or experiential meaning,
but which are doing important cohesive work in relating the clause to its context”. Textual Theme is
analysed in the following two ways: (1) Continuity Adjuncts and (2) Conjunctive Adjuncts; each will be
briefly described below.
Continuity Adjuncts are one type of Textual Adjuncts, they include continuative and continuity items,
often they are found in casual talk, thus they do not have a frequent occurrence in the data analysed.
They have no strong logical connection, just simply as a way to continue with what has been stated
previously. They show that the speaker will continue on the topic that he/she has been discussing, a
response or a possible new move in the discourse (Eggins 2004: 164). The most common types of
continuative adjuncts are the following: yes, no, well, oh, now. Below are examples demonstrating
continuative adjuncts which demonstrate some kind of continuation of what may have been stated
previously, the first well, the second, now, and the third, yes:
46
Marked Theme with continuative adjuncts: Textual Theme
Well, we begin this year and this administration in

Republican solutions – they expect
American solutions.
Continuative Adjunct
Yes, Congress has passed my economic recovery plan –
an ambitious plan at a time we badly
need it.
Continuative Adjunct
THEME RHEME
Moreover, Conjunctive adjuncts are adverbial groups or prepositional phrases which creates a relation
to the text that came before it, they link relations between one sentence to another. They mostly take
place at the beginning of a clause, but they can be found at other parts of a clause as well (Halliday and
Matthiesen 2004: 83). Conjunctive adjuncts can function as paratactic or hypotactic. Paratactic clauses
connect two independent clauses that relate to each other as equals, and they usually could stand alone
as a sentence (Eggins 2004: 263). Whereas, hypotactic clauses are related through a dependent
relationship (ibid: 266). In the analysis, both types of conjunctive adjuncts were very common,
paratactic and hypotactic. First, paratactic adjunct conjunctions will be presented.
Paratactic adjunct conjunctions examples include some of the following: and, or, nor, either…or,
neither…nor, but, yet, so, then, for
The two examples below demonstrate possible textual Theme with paratactic conjunctive adjuncts, the
first with but, and the second with and:

Hypotactic conjunctive adjunct examples include some of the following: when, while, before, after, until,
because, if, although, unless, since, that, whether, by, with, despite, as
As mentioned, hypotactic conjunctive adjuncts involve dependent clauses, thus the following examples
demonstrate this. The first example shows the hypotactic conjunctive adjunct because followed by of
the previous years, followed by the subject we. The second example shows the hypotactic conjunctive
adjunct despite followed your party affiliation followed by the subject they. And the third example shows

3.6.4 Multiple Theme
Above Theme was demonstrated and how it can be expressed through the metafunctions (ideational,
interpersonal and textual) all three types of Theme can also be present in the Thematic structure at the
same time: topical, interpersonal and textual. This is known as multiple Theme. The example below
demonstrates how this is possible. It begins with textual Theme with a conjunctive adjunct, and,
followed by another Textual Theme, a continuative adjunct, well, followed by interpersonal theme, a
vocative adjunct, America, then followed by topical Theme with the participant, we:

3.6.5 Other types of Theme
This last section reviews other types of Theme that may be found in the analysis and simply
demonstrate how they are analysed for Theme. They include the following: Thematized equatives, WH–
questions, Yes/No interrogatives, imperatives, exclamatives, existential Theme and demonstratives.
3.6.5.1 Thematized Equative
It is very common throughout the addresses that Obama states ‘that is why’ in the beginning of the
Thematic structure, this is followed by a subject, and he then completes the sentence by answering why
he has done this or why he has proposed that. This study placed ‘That is why’ under the Theme of
Thematic equative. Thematic equative is used when the speaker answers the question him/herself or as
a way to complete the message he/she wants to specifically deliver. He/She divides the message into
two pieces so that the listener will be able to understand in a clear way and he/she will be able to make
his/her point (Thompson 2004: 150). In reference to ‘that is why’, this study understands ‘that’ refers
back to what has been said and ‘is why’ answers the question proposed by the speaker him/herself and
thus it has been analysed as a Thematic equative. The example below is from the fourth Christmas
address (sentence 25). In this example Michelle Obama is speaking and she uses ‘That is why’ in the
Thematic structure followed by the subject Dr. Jill Biden and I, and she completes the sentence with the
Rheme. It is a strategy used as a way to specifically point out what she wants to say already within the
Thematic structure, which in this case was to say that she has begun working with Dr. Jill Biden to help
support veterans and military families.
Thematic Rheme
Equative
That’s why started Joining Forces – an effort to
Dr. Jill Biden rally all Americans to honor and
and I support our veterans and military
families.
3.6.5.2 WH-questions
49
Theme in WH-questions are unmarked, the WH-question serves as the Theme for the question and the
remaining is considered the Rheme:
Theme Rheme
What happened to dinner?
Why are you calling?
3.6.5.3 Yes/No interrogatives
The yes/no interrogatives, different from the WH-questions, include the subject in the Theme, and the
remaining is considered the Rheme:
Theme Rheme
Have we had enough of the crisis?
Did you see the fall of the market?
3.6.5.4 Imperatives
An imperative, a non-declarative clause, usually functions to get another person to do something or to
carry out an action (Thompson 2004: 147), and a clause of an imperative usually begins with the
verb/process. When imperatives are in the Thematic position, they are considered unmarked and the
Predicator is the Theme. Below are examples:
Unmarked Theme of Imperative clauses:
Theme Rheme
Let the government work for you.
Don’t worry about your current health care plan.
Let’s* pray as a nation.
The last example ‘Let’s’ is an important and prominent feature in the data. ‘Let’s’ is not the subject such
as ‘you’ but it includes ‘you and me’, it is an all-inclusive type of imperative. Therefore, ‘let’s’ is an
example of the involvement of both the speaker and the person spoken to (Halliday and Matthiessen
2004: 139; Thompson 2004: 148). It is an important aspect in Obama’s addresses for this is how he
includes the American people in his discourse when he chose to do so.
50
3.6.5.5 Exclamatives
Exclamatory clauses can also be analysed for Theme. They are a bit similar to WH-questions in that the
WH is part of the Theme. This is how they are analysed (samples from Thompson 2004: 148):
Theme Rheme
What a nice plant you’ve got!
How absolutely lovely she looks tonight!
3.6.5.6 Existential Theme
Existential Theme is when the existential process of ‘there’ is used in the subject position. In this study,
‘there’ is analysed as the Theme and the rest is considered Rheme:
Theme Rheme
There are many opposed to the plan.
There are many people suffering.
3.6.5.7 Demonstratives
When demonstratives (this, that, these, those) are in the Thematic position, the demonstratives are
then analysed as Theme. This is how they are analysed:
Theme Rheme
These are the possibilities for the future.
Those are the ones against the program.
3.7 Conclusion
This chapter discussed some slightly different perspectives on genre, but mainly from the perspective
offered by the Sydney School of SFL, which views genre as a staged, goal oriented social process. This
then led to the discussion of generic structuring, for a genre is realized through various stages in order
to reach the intended goal of a discourse, and it is these stages that generic structure is recognised.
Further, in order to determine how to recognise the stages at the lexico-grammar level, Theme/Rheme
was introduced, the textual metafunction of SFL. Theme/Rheme is what the writer/speaker chooses as
the point of departure of his/her message, and this study views Theme as everything that comes before
the verbal process. Theme/Rheme is a rather complex system and various types of Theme were
51
introduced, i.e. topical Theme, interpersonal theme, Textual Theme as well as Thematized equatives,
WH–questions, Yes/No interrogatives, imperatives, exclamatives, existential Theme and
demonstratives. The following chapter discusses the data and methods used for the analysis.

Data and Methods
4.1 Introduction
The previous chapter discussed genre, generic staging and Theme/Rheme. This chapter will discuss the
data and methods used for the research. It first discusses the data, including the history of the radio
address and its justification for its use. It explains how the data was chosen, from the economy, health
care, man-inflicted tragedy to Christmas. Secondly, in order to answer the following research questions:
5. Are there potential sub-genres within the genre of the American radio address?
6. Does context of situation play a vital role in determining the possibility of sub-genres? If so, to
what extent does the stability of a contextual situation influence the stability of a possible sub-
genre and/or vice versa?
7. How then to reveal sub-genres within a genre? Would an analysis of the generic structure of the
addresses be a viable option?
8. Further, in order to investigate the generic structure, would Theme/Rheme be an effective
method in determining the generic structure?
The chapter discusses how the notion of genre was used to reveal the social purpose and social aim.
Theme/Rheme will be explained, along with how it was used as an analytical tool to reveal the generic
structure of each address. Then, the reader will be walked through the four steps that were used in the
analysis. Next, the data will be discussed.
4.2 Data
This section first briefly discusses the history of the American Presidential Radio Address, including the
justification for the data, by addressing the similar economic situation that both FDR and Obama found
53
themselves in at the start of their administrations. Then it will explain how each of the selected data
was systematically chosen from the topics on the economy, through health care, man-inflicted tragedy
and Christmas
4.2.1 Brief History and Justification of data
The U.S. Presidential Address is a weekly radio address of the President of America to keep the
American people informed of the on-goings of the current administration. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the
first President to utilise this form of communication, first as Governor of the state of New York, then as
President beginning in 1933. The first radio addresses by Roosevelt were known as the ‘Fireside chats’
for “he understood […] that from time to time another mode of speaking to the public could even be
more effective - brief, friendly, informal talk delivered as if the president were sitting next to a fireplace,
visiting a typical American family in their own home” (Hamby 2004:124). Since Roosevelt, every US
president has taken advantage of this form of public communication, including President Barack
Obama.
The interesting parallel between these two presidents is that they both began their presidential career
in the context of great economic crisis in the U.S.A. – two crises that are also explicitly compared. In a
2013 article, Forbes Magazine2 wrote, in reference to the 2008 crisis, that America experienced “the
worst downturn since the Great Depression” and American Economist, Paul Krugman3 stated in 2009
“we’re probably facing the worst slump since the Great Depression.” Furthermore, each president used
the radio as a mode of interaction with the American people to introduce their economic ‘rescue plans’.
In March of 1933, the immediate issue for newly elected President Roosevelt was the banking crisis, so
he proposed the Emergency Banking Bill (EBB). Roosevelt used the radio for the first time as President
on Sunday 12th March, to inform the American people that his plan, EBB, had been approved and passed
by Congress. Interestingly, Obama used his first weekly radio address as President, on Saturday 24th
January 2009, to introduce to the American people his economic rescue plan, the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which was developed to help stimulate the U.S. economy during the
recent period of economic crisis.
Martin and Rose (2007: 1) say that “interaction is an instance of the speakers’ culture; we can also use
the text to interpret aspects of the culture it manifests”. The contexts of these two addresses are similar

in terms of an American president addressing the people during a period of great economic crisis as
well as using the radio to introduce their economic recovery plans to aid such a crisis. However, while
comparing FDR with Obama, the context of American culture has evolved over seventy-six years -
there having been major changes in American politics, and more even specifically in political
discourse, and most relevant for this study’s purposes, changes in the generic structure of the
discourse of the radio address.
For example, FDR’s first address is structured into 12 generic stages (see Appendix C), where he
‘educates’ the American public on how a bank functions and then explicitly instructs them on what to
do (Kunst: forthcoming). However, Obama addresses the nation by discussing the gravity of the crisis,
and this has repercussions on how his addresses are generically structured. And as mentioned, the
thesis also researched how his addresses are generically structured in different context, such as
healthcare, man-inflicted tragedies, and Christmas. The following section discusses the data and how it
was selected.
4.2.2 The Economy, Healthcare, Man-inflicted Tragedy and Christmas
The data used for this study are the Presidential Radio Addresses of President Obama’s first term as
President (2009-2012), broken down into 4 topics: The Economy (4 addresses); Healthcare (4
addresses); Man-inflicted Tragedies (4 addresses); and Christmas (4 addresses). After, the author of
this study noticed the sequence in the four addresses on the economy and how Obama delivered them
in chronological order, he began to search the second most spoken topic in 2009 and discovered it was
health care. Health care also had a similar pattern to the topic of the economy, in terms of following in
close sequence one after the other. So, the first four addresses on health care were chosen in
chronological order. The study searched for other topics that were completely different in nature. The
study found that by chance Obama delivered only four addresses on the topic of man-inflicted tragedy
during his entire term of his first presidency and they are in chronological order as well. Finally,
Christmas was chosen, there are only four and are in chronological order (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012).
Moreover, the topic was completely different from the other three. The number ‘four’ then became the
trend in the number of addresses analysed per repertoire. This pattern can be observed in Appendix B,
where it lists all of the addresses that Obama delivered in his first term by date, topic and title; the
addresses selected for this study are marked and highlighted.
4.3 The Genre and Register of the Data
55
As discussed in chapter three, genre maps the cultural conventions on the level of context of culture.
Context of culture can be defined as the ways our societies map social, institutionalized practices and
actions into typical, predictable patterns of unfolding generic structures. These generic structures can
then be considered ‘relatively stable components’ and are organized in a way that can be recognized in
some type of form, instance after instance (Martin & Rose 2007: 10). And the radio address is then a
genre within the cultural conventions of an American president with institutionalized practices and
social expectations within the context of American culture.

Figure 4.1: The overall data and how it connects up
Figure 4.1 above visually exhibits the overall data and how it connects. The top tier is the over-arching
genre, the radio address and on the left are the register and its variables concerning this ‘umbrella’
genre: ‘F’, field (what is going on?), ‘T’, tenor (what participants are involved?), ‘M’, mode (How the
language is being used?). The field is Obama speaking to the nation regarding the most current event
of the week, the tenor is Obama and the American people, and finally, the mode is the written-to-be-
spoken (political) discourse, presented in multimodal ways (the radio, video, internet, written
transcripts). Below, the overarching genre is divided into the potential sub-genres within the same
56
genre of the radio address. This is represented by a ‘repertoire of registers’, which are addresses
having similar register variables (field, tenor, mode).
These repertoires are divided, into the four previously mentioned topics from left to right: the
economy, healthcare, man-inflicted tragedies, and Christmas. To the left, below these divisions are the
field, tenor and mode pertaining to each of the aforementioned repertoires. For the economy, the field
is Obama discussing the economic crisis and the American Recovery Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the
tenor is Obama and the American people, and mode is the written-to-be-spoken (political) discourse;
for health care, the field is Obama discussing an urgent need to reform the health care system in the
United States, and again the tenor is Obama and the American people, and the mode is the written-to-
be-spoken (political) discourse. For man-inflicted tragedies, the field is Obama addressing a man-
inflicted tragedy that has recently occurred in the U.S. at the time the address was delivered (shooting
at military base, shooting at a political event, shooting at a cinema, shooting at an elementary school),
the tenor and the mode same as before; for Christmas, the field is Obama and the First Lady, Michelle
Obama, wishing the American people a Merry Christmas, and again, the tenor and the mode are the
same as the others. Below the general field, tenor, and mode of the four different repertoires is the
sub-register. The sub-register contains the four addresses that belong to each of the four repertoires,
they are represented by the numbers one to four, each address has its field, tenor and mode, and then
each address will be specifically discussed in the coinciding analytical chapters (chapters five to eight).
The next section discusses the methods used to determine the generic structure of each address and
the proposed steps used in the analysis by the author.
4.3.1 Generic Structure, Theme/Rheme and Steps of the Analysis
In order to find the typical, predictable patterns of unfolding generic structures of the addresses in
each repertoire, the thematic progression of the addresses has been analysed by way of identifying
Thematic Structure. Again (discussed in chapter three), the generic structure can be seen as providing
“insight into how different genres enable language users to achieve their social purposes by moving
through distinct functional stages” (Coffin et al 2009: 252). As mentioned, this study aimed to realise
here the different stages of the addresses by Obama. Theme/Rheme was chosen as the effective tool to
use because it is the point of departure that the speaker/writer chooses to orient the listener/speaker
within its specific context, the rest of the message is then developed in the Rheme (Halliday and
Mattheisen 2004: 64). Theme also contributes to the flow of discourse, for it demonstrates the
connectedness within each address, or, also, the lack of connectedness, which in turn will demonstrate
a new starting point within Obama’s message, thus signaling a change and a new move (refer back to
chapter three for more about Theme). The thematic structure specifically shows what Obama chose to
57
talk about, what topics he decided to highlight, and how the topics changed throughout one address.
Thus, analysing the thematic structure of Obama’s addresses deemed beneficial in revealing how the
generic structure of the addresses unfolds. The author developed four precise steps to reveal the
potential generic moves of the data. They are as follows:
The analysis of the data in the following 4 steps:
Step One:
Each sentence of each address was analysed by way of Theme/Rheme. This study considered
analysing the clauses of a clause complex sentence, but found that subsequent clauses within a
sentence were connected to the same topic of the first clause of the sentence, for example:
Theme Rheme
1 1a We begin this year and this
Administration in the midst of
an unprecedented crisis
1b that calls for unprecedented
action.
In the example above, sentence 1 has two clauses, 1a and 1b, the second clause has the Theme as a
demonstrative, that, and clearly connects to the Theme/Rheme of the previous clause: that the
“unprecedented crisis” needs “unprecedented action”, thus the topic of the sentence is the same (see
example below). Even though there may be more than one clause in a sentence, the study normally
found that it pertained to the same topic that was introduced in the first clause. Further, the study is
concerned about the generic structure of the entire address as a whole, thus focused on only analyzing
the sentences of each address. However, with this being said, many single clause sentences were
present and analysed throughout the data.
Theme Rheme
1 We begin this year and this Administration in the midst of
an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented
action.
In step one, the Theme/Rheme analysis determined the generic moves within an address and divided
them into ‘sections’. The study analysed the Theme/Rheme at the sentence level and found that
through the Theme (with Rheme as well) the generic moves of an address were able to be determined.

Further, the Theme was divided into the four categories of Textual, Interpersonal, Topical: marked,
and Topical: unmarked (as explained in chapter three).
The example below demonstrates the first generic move of the first address from the repertoire on the
economy (E1:1 – 5). This move included five sentences and shows the Theme on the left (We; Just this
week, we; Our economy; And we; In short, if, we do not act boldly and swiftly, a bad situation) and
on the right is a summary of what was stated in the Rheme (Obama begins by talking about the dark
condition of the economy and the need to react in order to get something done). Each individual
analytical chapter will detail each generic move.

Steps Two and Three:
Then after step one, the Thematic analysis, the author divided and demonstrated the moves from each
address and this included a summary of each individual move, step two. The example below shows
that a total of seven generic moves were identified in E1, the column on the reader’s left. Next to each
numbered generic move of the first column is the summary of the move, the center column. For
example, generic move two, the summary is: Obama introduced his plan to help the economy and he
explained that it is now in Congress and what it will do. Further, step three then took the summary and
simplified the move into a few words (the column on the reader’s right), for example, in sentence two
again where he introduced his plan, this was simplified into “His plan”. Or generic move five, where he
discussed not wasting money and introduced a new website, this was simplified into “a new website”.

Step Four:
After step three, step four collected the generic moves that were determined in step three and
combined them with the results of the analysis in all the addresses from one repertoire. This enabled
the comparison and contrast of the findings of all the addresses within that repertoire into a chart. The
example below demonstrates this, it comprises all four addresses from the repertoire on the economy.
The addresses are identified as follows: E1 = Economy, first address; E2 = Economy, second address;
E3 = Economy, third address; E4 = Economy, fourth address. The same practice allows us to compare
and contrast all of the findings from all four repertoires (economy, health care, man-inflicted tragedies,
and Christmas).

After the above steps and determining the generic moves, the study will be able to compare and
contrast the generic moves and the structure as a result of the analysis as well as specify the
convergences and divergences first as one repertoire and then comparing/contrasting with the others.
Moreover, the overall types of Theme found in the analysis will be calculated and compared and
contrasted with one another. Also, the major trends found in terms of motif will revealed. Finally, the
types of Theme that indicated a move will be discussed. The following chapter is the first analytical
chapter, dealing with the grouping on the economy.

Chapter 5
The Economy
5.1 Introduction
This first chapter of the analysis begins by investigating the repertoire of registers that focus on the
economy. The context of the situation is the economic recession of 2009 and Obama’s economic plan,
the American Recovery Act (ARRA). This chapter analyses the generic structure of the very first four
radio addresses ever delivered by Obama as President in chronological order. Figure 5.1 below
demonstrates the context of situation through field, tenor and mode. The top tier is the over-arching
genre, the radio address and on the left are the register and its variables concerning this sub-genre of
the economy: field, answering what is going on, is Obama speaking about the economic crisis field and
ARRA; ‘T’, tenor, answering what participants are involved, includes: Obama, his administration,
Congress and the American people; ‘M’, mode, answering how the language is being used, is written-to-
be-spoken (political) discourse, presented in multimodal ways via the radio, video, internet and
written transcripts.
The first address, delivered on 24 January 2009, is titled “President Obama Delivers Your Weekly
Radio Address”; the specific field is President Obama introducing the ARRP to the American people (by
this time the plan had already been introduced to the House of Representatives, one part of congress,
the Senate being the other part). The second address, delivered on 31 January 2009, is titled “Moving
Forward”, the specific field is Obama informing the American public that the United States House of
Representatives has passed his plan, and is now moving to the second part of congress, the Senate, for
approval. The third address, delivered on 2 February 2009, is titled “Compromise”, the specific field is
Obama stressing the importance of his plan and the fight to pass this plan in the Senate. Then, in the
fourth and last address, delivered on 14 February 2009, titled “A Major Milestone”, the specific field is
Obama triumphantly telling the American people that ARRP has been passed by Congress. He says that
he will be signing it into law shortly, just as he had promised in the first address. The following section

will begin to discuss and Thematically analyse the generic structure of Obama’s very first Radio
Address as President of the United States.

5.2 “President Obama Delivers Your Weekly Radio Address”
This section introduces and briefly summarizes the address. This is the first address that Obama
delivered as President, it pertained to the economic crisis and was delivered on January 24, 2009 (33
sentences). This address begins with Obama talking about the dark condition of the economy and the
need to react in order to get something done. He then introduces his plan to help the economy, ARRA,
he further explains that the plan is now with Congress and they are discussing, debating, while Obama
is hoping that they pass it. Moreover, he talks about how the plan will help the economic crisis within
America. He then goes into more specifics about ARRA, and how exactly it will help, for example with
education, with health care, it will help with the climate change as well as with technology. This
address then moves into the skepticism and those that they oppose it, but he demonstrates how he
will prove against the skepticism. Before the conclusion, Obama states that he does recognise the fact
that not one program will be the total solution for the serious economic crisis, however, he offers his
encouragement and states that the country needs to act in order to overcome difficult financial times.
The following section will then demonstrate the Thematic analysis of this address.

5.2.1 The Thematic Analysis
This section reveals the Thematic analysis and demonstrates where potential generic moves are
within this address, which can then lead to the generic structure of this first address. The first generic

Table 5.1: The seven generic moves of the first address on the economy
The trends viewed in these generic moves are a negative comment, followed by two moves about his
plan, this continues with the opposition of the plan, then with a new website to find out more
information regarding the plan and the urgency to act. The major theme of this address is the plan.
The trends in the types of Theme in this address are as follows: there are nine textual Themes (27%),
no interpersonal Themes, 13 topical marked Themes (39%), ten topical unmarked Themes (30%) and
one with no Theme (3%), as can be seen in Table 5.2:
Textual Interpersonal Topical: marked Topical: unmarked No Theme
9 (27%) 0 13 (39%) 10 (30%) 1 (3%)
Table 5.2: Type of Theme in the first economic address
Out of the nine instances of textual Theme, three were instances of the paratactic conjunction ‘and’;
four were instances of hypotactic conjunctions, one with a summative conjunction ‘in short, if’, and the
other with a contrastive paratactic conjunction, ‘but if’; two instances of ‘if’ alone; and one instance of a
continuative conjunction, ‘finally’ and an enhancing conjunction ‘then’. Out of the 13 topical marked
Themes, four are marked because of hypotactic clauses, two are marked because of circumstance of
time, one is marked because it is a demonstrative, ‘that’; another is marked for it is a pronoun
substitute, ‘it’; and finally one is marked for it is a thematised comment. The ten topical unmarked
71
Themes include six subjects of ‘we’, two subjects of ‘I’, one subject of ‘our economy’ and one of ‘no one
policy or program’.
Further, the seven generic moves in this address began with the following types of Theme:
1. The first move began with topical unmarked: ‘We’
2. The second move began with topical marked Theme, a thematic equative: ‘That is why’
3. The third move began with topical marked Theme, circumstance of time: ‘Today, I’
4. The fourth move began with topical unmarked: ‘We’
5. The fifth move began with topical unmarked: ‘We’
6. The sixth move began with topical unmarked Theme: ‘No one policy or program’
7. The seventh move, no Theme: ‘Thanks for listening’
The following section will continue with the analysis of the second address that Obama delivered
regarding the economy.
5.3 “Moving Forward”
This section introduces and briefly summarizes the second address that Obama delivered as President.
The address also pertained to the economic crisis and was given on January 31, 2009 (42 sentences).
This address will be explained in greater detail as it analysed Thematically in the following section.
This address begins with stating that he wants to talk about some good and bad news pertaining to the
economic crisis, for example the economy shrank and there were more jobs lost, thus unemployment
rose. He then goes into how Americans are being specifically affected by the economic crisis, from
families to parents, from patients to students. After the bad news, he states the good news in which the
House of Representatives has passed his bill, ARRA. He then speaks to Congress to ask them to pass
the bill as well and tells them to avoid partisanship, but rather there should be bipartisanship during
the difficult time of the economic crisis. He then returns to discuss how many Americans are
financially struggling, from homeowners to students and to small businesses, this plea is most likely
directed to Congress, to encourage them to pass the reform. He then discusses the plan and how it will
revive the financial system. This address ends with Obama stating that Congress must work together
for the benefit of all Americans. The following section will demonstrate the Thematic analysis and
potential generic structure of the address.
5.3.1 The Thematic Analysis

This section reveals the Thematic analysis and demonstrates where potential generic moves are

unmarked Themes: Many Americans, Families, Parents, Patients, Students, and the last Theme is

subject, workers. In these sentences he states that American lives have “turned upside down” as a
result of the economic crisis, for example they are struggling to pay bills, they can’t afford health care,
students cannot pay for their schooling and workers do not have the security of retirement. The next

The trends viewed in these generic moves are negative and positive comments, the address continues
with a move that negatively illustrates how Americans are suffering, the next move is regarding his
plan, followed by a call for bipartisanship regarding his plan, the next move again is a negative
illustration of Americans, followed by the plan again, and ending with encouraging remarks of working
together. The major theme of this address is the plan and negative illustrations of the economic crisis.
The trends in the types of Theme in this address are as follows: there are 11 textual Themes (26%), no
interpersonal Themes, 14 topical marked Themes (33%), 17 topical unmarked Themes (67%) and
zero clauses without Theme, as can be seen in Table 5.4:

Out of the 11 instances of textual Theme, there is one verifative conjunction, ‘already’; four were
instances of the paratactic conjunction ‘and’; two were instances of the contrastive paratactic
conjunction ‘but’; two instances of ‘while’, a hypotactic conjunction; one instance of ‘so’, a paratactic

Themes, six are marked because of circumstance of time; one is marked because it is a demonstrative,
‘that’; two are marked for a pronoun substitute, ‘it’; four are marked because they are hypotactic
clauses; and finally one is marked for it is a thematised comment. The 17 topical unmarked Themes

news’, ‘I’, ‘Americans’, ‘No one bill, no matter how comprehensive’, ‘Banks’, ‘The road to recovery’, ‘Rarely

The following section will continue with the analysis of the third address that Obama delivered
regarding the economy.
5.4 “Compromise”
This section introduces and briefly summarizes this address. This is the third address that Obama
delivered as President, it also pertained to the economic crisis as well as ARRA. It was delivered on
February 2, 2009 (35 sentences). It will only be briefly summarised here, for this address will be
explained in greater detail as it was analysed Thematically in the following section. Thus, Obama
begins by introducing that there is good news and there is bad news. He then states that there have
been more jobs that have been lost, thus further affecting the unemployment. He then explains the
81
good news that there is bipartisanship in Congress, that both political parties are working together to
solve the problem of the economic crisis. He then discusses the scrutiny of the legislation, but he also
focuses on the idea that too much time cannot be spent on scrutinizing the reform for there is a sense
of urgency to act in order to improve the financial crisis. He thus speaks directly to Congress and tells
them that they cannot rely on old theories from the past, he asks them not be partisan but to rather
think of the needs of the American people. After this, he discusses the plan and goes into some details
of what it will aim to accomplish. He then again speaks to Congress, basically urging them to pass the
economic plan, ARRA, and this is followed by the conclusion. The following section will then
demonstrate the Thematic analysis and potential generic structure of this address.
5.4.1 The Thematic Analysis

5.5 “A Major Milestone”
This section introduces and briefly summarizes the fourth and final address of this repertoire. This is
the fourth address that Obama delivered as President, it also pertained to the economic crisis as well
as ARRA, his economic plan. It was delivered on February 14, 2009 (38 sentences). To summarise, this
address begins with Obama talking about the financial struggles that Americans are going through as a
result of the economic crisis. He states that they are looking towards the government for help in
regards to this situation. He then tells the people that Congress has passed ARRA, his economic plan.
He says this is a major milestone and it will help Americans get back to work again and help stimulate
the economy. He then goes into somewhat detail about the work that will be done in order to get
America on the right financial path. He also says that he does understand that there is some skepticism
regarding this but he claims that there will be accountability, responsibility and transparency. And in
order to be as transparent as possible he introduces a new website where Americans can go to leave
comments and to ask questions. He then discusses that this is an historic step for America, but there is
a lot of work still to be done, in which he specifies, in order to repair the damage that has caused the
economic crisis including the doubling of debt and an increase in deficit as a result of the previous
eight years. He then begins to conclude this address with a quote by President Kennedy that is
connected to the idea of uncertain times as well as with words of encouragement, reinforcing the idea
to the American people that improving the situation is possible. The address ends with “thank you”.
5.5.1 The Thematic Analysis

5.5.2 The Findings in the Fourth Address
The previous section discussed the eight generic moves of this fourth address that were realized by
way of the Thematic analysis, this section will then discuss the potential generic structure of the
address. As stated there are eight generic moves in this address (see Table 5.7). The first was the

The trends viewed in these generic moves are first negative comments, the next move is regarding his
plan and that it was passed, the next move again is about the plan, followed by being responsible and
transparent, the next move is regarding a website, the following move is negative comments again and
conclusion. The major theme of this address is his plan, negative comments and a new website for
transparency.
The trends in the types of Theme in this address are as follows: there are seven textual Themes (18%),
one interpersonal Theme (3%), 12 topical marked Themes (4%), 16 topical unmarked Themes (42%)
and two without Theme (5%), as can be seen in Table 5.8:
Textual Interpersonal Topical: marked Topical: unmarked No Theme
7 (18%) 1 (3%) 12 (4%) 16 (42%) 2 (5%)
Table 5.8: Type of Theme in the fourth economic address
Out of the seven instances of textual Theme, there are three paratactic conjunctions, ‘And’; one
contrastive paratactic conjunction, ‘but’; one hypotactic conjunction, ‘because’; and two continuative
conjunctions, ‘now’ and ‘ultimately’. Out of the 12 topical marked Themes, three are marked because of
circumstance of time; three are marked because they are hypotactic clauses; three are marked because
they are demonstratives, ‘this’, ‘that’; two are marked for a pronoun substitute, ‘it’; and one is marked
for a thematic equative, ‘that is why’. The 16 topical unmarked Themes include 16 subjects that are
also somewhat diverse. The subject ‘work of’ was repeated three times; the first person plural, ‘we’,
was repeated twice; the others were: ‘People’, ‘Families’, ‘Folks’, ‘They’, ‘Congress’, ‘Washington’, ‘I’, ‘This
historic step’, ‘The problems that led us into this crisis’, ‘Our response’, and ‘Our debt’.
Further, the eight generic moves in this address began with the following types of Theme:
1. The first move began with topical marked Theme, circumstance of time: ‘This week’’
2. The second move began with topical marked Theme, circumstance of time: ‘This morning’
3. The third move began with topical unmarked Theme: ‘The work of’
4. The fourth move began with textual Theme, a continuative conjunction: ‘Now’
5. The fifth move began with a topical marked Theme, a hypotactic clause: ‘Once the plan is put

7. The seventh move began with topical marked Theme, circumstance of time: ‘This morning’
8. The eighth move had no Theme: ‘Thank you’
The following section will compare and contrast the generic structure of all four addresses that were
analysed in this chapter.
5.6 Findings and Discussion
This section will first reveal the overall types of Theme found in the analysis, then it will discuss as
well as compare and contrast the generic moves and the structure as a result of the analysis. And,
finally, it will discuss the major trends found and demonstrate the types of Theme that indicated a
move. This first chapter of the analysis investigated the repertoire of registers focusing on the
economy. The field for this repertoire was the economic recession of 2009 which includes Obama’s bill
and the American Recovery Act. The first address analysed was titled “President Obama Delivers Your
Weekly Radio Address”, delivered on 24 January 2009. The specific field was President Obama’s
introduction of ARRP to the American people. The second address analysed was titled “Moving
Forward”, delivered on 31 January 2009. The specific field was Obama informing Americans that the
United States House of Representatives has passed his plan, and was now moving to the second part of
congress, the Senate, for approval. The third address analysed was titled “Compromise”, delivered on 2
February 2009. The specific field was Obama stressing the importance of his plan and the fight to pass
his plan in the Senate. The fourth and last address analysed in this chapter was titled “A Major
Milestone”, delivered on 14 February 2009. The specific field was Obama telling Americans that ARRP
was passed by Congress.

Table 5.10: Comparing and contrasting the economic addresses
Comparing and contrasting these four addresses within the register on the economy, there are many
similar generic moves within the generic structure of these addresses, see Table 5.10. But, they did
contrast slightly in terms of topic. In E1, President Obama introduced his economic plan, ARRP, to the
American people and announced the plan had already been introduced to the House of
Representatives. E2, he informed the American public that the United States House of Representatives
has passed his plan, and is now moving to the second part of congress, the Senate, for approval. Then
in E3, he stressed the importance of his plan and the fight to pass this plan in the Senate. And in E4, he
told the American people that the plan had passed and it would be become law.
Within this topic, there are many comparable similarities. In all four addresses, the introduction was
negative at least partly. In E1 he began by speaking about the dark situation, in E2 and E3, he began by
introducing good news and bad news. In E4, the introduction dealt with the struggles of Americans,
thus the introductions are quite similar by beginning with a negative aspect. In terms of the plan, E1 is
the only address where there are generic moves that dealt with the actual plan, this is appropriate
though, since all these addresses discussed the plan and so the first introduced it, while the other three
Obama focused on passing it through congress. There is a generic move regarding the plan in E2 as
well as in E3, which includes the mention of the ‘American Dream’. There are as well, similar moves
addressing the subject of the opposition. In E1, he discussed the opposition and he wanted to prove
against, there is a similar move where he addressed the skepticism after it was passed. Here he
discussed accountability, responsibility and transparency. And with the new transparency he
mentioned in E4, he introduced a website where Americans could be updated as well as see what the
administration is doing regarding the economic plan. This was also seen in E1, there was a generic
move regarding an introduction of a website. There were also many moves regarding the call for
bipartisanship, at least four moves, which one included a clear message to Congress about passing the
bill and to not let the notion of political parties interfere with the bill’s passage. Furthermore, before
the plan was passed, there were generic moves regarding the ‘need to act now’, a sense of urgency.
This was first seen in E1, and then in E2, there was a generic move where he informed the people that
it has been passed by the House of Representatives. Then again, in E3, there was a generic move
regarding the ‘need to act now’, and then in E4, he announced in a generic move that the Senate had
passed the plan, thus there was a ‘cause and effect’ between these moves, the need to act and then it
was passed by the House, again the need to act and then it was passed by the Senate. The conclusion
with the last address, E4, he ended in quite formally and much different than the first three
conclusions, he ended it with a quote by John F. Kennedy, as if bringing the group of these four
addresses to a formal conclusion.

The Trends found in the Economic Addresses
This section will briefly view the trends found in the addresses in very simplistic terms to understand
the major thread that connected them. The trends observed in the first address was a negative
comment, followed by two moves about his plan, this continued with the opposition of the plan, then
with a new website to find out more information regarding the plan and the urgency to act. The major
motif of this address was the plan and website. The trends observed in the second address was
negative and positive comments, it continued with a move that negatively illustrates how Americans
were suffering, the next move was regarding his plan, followed by a call for bipartisanship regarding
his plan, the next move again was a negative illustration of Americans, followed by the plan again, and
ending with encouraging remarks. The major motif of this address was the plan, negative comments
and bipartisanship. The trends seen in the third address were negative and positive comments, it
continued with negative and positive comments, the next move was regarding his plan and the need to
act, followed by a message to Congress, a call for bipartisanship, the next move again was about the
plan, followed by another message to Congress to pass the plan, call for bipartisanship. The major
themes of this address were his plan, messages to Congress, bipartisanship, negative and positive
comments. The trends viewed in the fourth address were first negative comments, the next move was
regarding his plan and that it was passed, the next move again was about the plan, followed by being
responsible and transparent, the next move was regarding a website, the following move was negative
comments again and conclusion. The major themes of this address were his plan, negative comments
and a website for transparency.
The major threads in these addresses were the following: the plan, negative comments,
bipartisanship and a website. In every address he spoke of the plan in one way or another, in an
effort to try to ‘sell’ it to the American people, and to Congress, speaking of all the major benefits that
would come from it. A strong component of bipartisanship was present since Obama was trying to win
over the Republicans in Congress. This was the beginning of his term as a Democratic President, after
an eight-year Republican administration, and it was a challenge for him to win over the support that
he needed. Negativity played a role in this repertoire. This was identified from the standpoint of the
economic crisis or from speaking about the administration that preceded him. Negativity was an
important element because making the economic situation as bleak as possible, thus making his plan
even more appealing to the general public. If one is trying to sell something, negativity is an aspect
beneficial in order to show the positive that is needed. The final strong motif was Obama providing a
website for the American people in order to find out more information about ARRA. At the time this
was a novelty with an American President, it showed the modernity of his Presidency, and how a
101
business style of communication was utilised by making the American public feel as though they were
part of the conversation.

Table 5.11: Types of theme that indicated a move in the economic addresses
This section compares the types of Themes that were observed within all four address when a new
generic move began, see Table 5.11. Each summary of an individual address demonstrates what the
Theme was (please refer back to that section), this section will investigate any type of patterns or
common threads found among them. These addresses were quite similar in length and had on average
seven to eight generic moves. First in E1, there were four unmarked Themes, one Thematic equative,
one circumstance of time, and one without Theme. In E2, there were four unmarked Themes, two
circumstance of time, one Thematic comment, and one textual Theme. In E3, there was one unmarked
Theme, three circumstance of Time, one hypotactic clause, one all-inclusive imperative, and one with
no Theme. In E4, there were two unmarked Themes, three circumstance of Time, one textual Theme,
one hypotactic clause and one with no Theme.
102
To review the types of Theme that indicated a move in these addresses, Theme as circumstance of
time strongly emerged at a total of nine times. It was fitting for these addresses because time was of
the essence, first with the economic crisis that was occurring and the urgency that Obama had trying
to pass ARRA. Unmarked Theme was another common thread indicating a move at a total of eleven
times. The only pattern emerged was in E1, where Obama used the third person plural pronoun, ‘we’,
this functioned well in the first address because he was discussing how they needed to act quickly
because of the crisis, and by Obama using ‘we’, everyone was placed in the situation. The unmarked
Themes in the rest of the addresses were quite random and did not contain any other personal
pronouns nor any particular pattern, such subjects as, ‘the bad news’, ‘the good news’, or ‘this historic
step’.
Another common thread that emerged was the placement of types of Theme used at the beginning of a
generic move, particularly, in the first and the last generic moves. The use of circumstance of time as
Theme in the first generic move was used three out of the four addresses. Obama began these
addresses with: ‘this morning’, ‘yesterday’ or ‘last week’. This demonstrated how current the issue was
regarding the economy, it was an issue that he felt needed immediate attention and he was
determined to pass ARRA. In the last generic move, there was no Theme in three out of the four
address, he ended with a simple ‘thank you’ in most.
The following chapter, the second analytical chapter, will analyse the repertoire of registers regarding
health care. The chapter will observe how different or similar they are according to their register and
generic structure.

Chapter 6
Health Care
6.1 Introduction
Moving away from the repertoire of register on the Economy, this chapter investigates the first four
radio addresses concerning the healthcare reform in the United States, where he begins to discuss the
need to re-structure the whole healthcare system of the country. This repertoire of register (see Figure
6.1) is all from his first year as President in 2009. The general field is Obama speaking about reforming
the American healthcare system, this does change between each address. The tenor includes Obama,
his administration, Congress and the American people, and the mode is multimodal. They are in
sequential order, meaning they are the first four radio addresses that he delivered on the topic of
healthcare reform, similarly how the addresses on the economy were his first addresses ever
delivered on that topic. There are gaps in dates among these addresses, this is because he discussed
other topics within those gaps. Therefore, this chapter will analyse the generic structure of the radio
address regarding the healthcare in chronological order.
First, it begins with his address delivered on June 6, 2009, titled “President Obama Calls for Real
Healthcare Reform”, and the specific field of this address is Obama discussing the high cost of health
care, and the need to change it. Following, his second address from June 13, 2009 is titled “Healthcare
Reform as the Key to Our Fiscal Future”, the specific field of this address is Obama talking about health
care and the fiscal responsibility for the future of America. The third address analysed, from July 18,
2009, is titled “Health care Reform Cannot Wait”, the specific field is Obama addressing the opposition
and the supporters of the plan. Finally, the last address analysed in this chapter was delivered on July
25, 2009 and is titled “Health Insurance Reform, Small Businesses and Your Questions”, the specific
field is the narrative of small business owners who struggle in America in regards to the costs of health
insurance. The next section will move to discuss and analyse the first address for this register.
